For over a decade, Final Fantasy VII has been a ê
_ê
highly appreciated game, and it has been nominee for   oO  © Absolute Steve   Oo
&quot;best game ever&quot; countless times. This strategy guide  ||  Version: Ultimate  ||
allows you to relive this classic in its full glory,   Oo faq@shillatime.org  oO
or, to put it in different words: &quot;You've played FF VII  Øê
before, but you've never BEATEN it ... yet!&quot;

Final Fantasy VII has always been one of my favorite games ever, and this guide
remains a pet project. It's amazing how many deep themes the story explores and
how many subtle references are hidden away in the game. One can also point to
the many 'beauty' imperfections the game has, which have led to an unprecedented
amount of research on the game by fans all over the world. These imperfections
have - paradoxically - made the game more interesting for many of us. The fact
that official guides and sources lacked enormous amounts of information allowed
a large pile of secrets to stack up, which of course has been harvested over the
years and is now presented to you in this guide. It furthermore appears to be
the case that the older one grows, the more one is able to appreciate the game's
unparalleled humor, incredible soundtrack, numerous secrets, and the melancholic
nostalgia of the days when games were primarily about gameplay, radical jokes
and philosophical or literary narrative.

This guide is a recollection of a vast amount of information that has been
unearthed from Final Fantasy VII over the years, and as of yet, the source
seemingly hasn't dried up. It also contains unique, self-researched information
and a walkthrough with notes on when (un)official sidequests become available,
along with notes on how to boost your party to perfection in an optional
'Perfect Game' challenge.

There are still moments when I wish to make a beautiful printed guide (or at the
very least, a definite guide in PDF format) out of this document, but it would
require a team of people, or at the very least a very skilled designer willing
to take on this task pro deo.  Do let yourself be heard if you're out there.
So far, interestingly enough, several people have sent me an email over the
years, showing initial interest. But apparently such interest is but a temporary
spark, as they're never again heard from after follow-up email correspondence.

Rests me to wish you a lot of pleasure with Final Fantasy VII. I can only hope
that this guide does justice to the depth of the game.

Steve

This section contains the controls of the game, including some menu controls
that are much less widely known but rather useful. It also contains useful tips
which could save you a lot of time. Keep in mind that you can always go to the
Beginners Hall in the game (located in the Sector 7 Slums and upper Junon) for
more basic and in-depth information regarding the game.

Field Controls (In towns, etc):
-ê
D-pad ê= Moving around
X ê= (Hold + D-pad) to run
Square   = Nothing
O ê= 'Ok button', talking, grabbing treasure
Triangle = Open menu
L1 ê= (Hold + D-pad) to move diagonally
R1 ê= (Hold + D-pad) to move diagonally
L2/R2 ê= Nothing
Start ê= Nothing
Select   = Displays exits (red), ladders (green) and a cursor above Cloud
L1+R1+L2+R2+Start+Select = Soft Reset

Battle Controls:
-ê
D-pad ê= Moving in the menu
X ê= Cancel button
Square   = (Hold to) hide menu (to see HP/MP stats)
O ê= Select command
Triangle = Switch to other available character (no turn loss)
L1+R1 ê= (Hold to) escape from battle
L1 ê= Scroll through menu quickly
R1 ê= Scroll through menu quickly
L2 ê= Toggles display of available 'Targets'
R2 ê= Nothing
Start ê= Pause
Select   = Displays extra bar with additional help info (including enemy names)

Useful Menu Controls:
-ê
Triangle = Unequip Materia/Accessory
L1/R1 ê= Swap between characters in submenu's

o In Materia Menu: Move cursor to Arrange and select Arrange for arranging
  Materia by sort/color, Exchange allows moving materia from/to any character
o You can select weapon or armor to swap all the materia in that piece of
  equipment to another character's weapon or armor.
o In Status Menu: Press O multiple times for Elemental/Status Ailments info
o In PHS Menu: Press O on character twice to view additional info
o In Config Menu: Many options available, ATB at Wait is useful for starters,
  that will allow you to scroll through menus without being attacked. Memory
  will put the cursor where you left it the previous time in battle.

WARNING: CHANGING THE CONTROLS FROM THE DEFAULT IN CUSTOM CONTROLS WILL CAUSE
 ê	PROBLEMS WITH FOR EXAMPLE: CHOCOBO BREEDING, CLIMBING SOME LADDERS
 ê	(MOST NOTABLY THE ONE IN BONE VILLAGE), AND SEVERAL MINIGAMES, SUCH AS
 ê	THE PARADING MINIGAME!

General Tips:
-ê
o Save often and keep multiple files. You can never have enough save files.
o Keep a stock of Potions, Hi-Potions, X-Potions and Phoenix Downs.
o Organize your inventory. Organizing by 'Type' will group all similar items
  together, allowing for faster and effective usage during battle.
o Explore and talk to everyone multiple times; You'll often get a piece of
  interesting information out of them, or better yet, a great item.
o Double growth equipment can be a better choice than a stronger piece of
  equipment, as your Materia will gain better magic at a much faster rate.
o Long range characters (Barret, Yuffie and Vincent) should be placed in the
  back row with the 'Order' option in your menu, as they'll take less damage
  this way. There are only a few weapons for long range characters that are not
  long ranged.
o Many enemies have their own unique weakness. Humans can often be poisoned and
  mechanical enemies are weak against lightning. Airborne creatures are almost
  always weak against wind, but avoid any earth-based attacks.
o Focus on a single enemy until it dies. This is a better method than to damage
  all enemies just a little. Remember they'll all attack back at some point.
o Once you can get Hypers, it may be useful to give them to your characters
  which gives them the status 'Fury'. Under this status, your Limit Break will
  fill up TWICE as fast (the limit bar will be red). The only downside is that
  your characters will miss more often, but this is still a great way to learn
  new limit breaks!
o Alternatively, you can put your characters in Sadness by giving them
  Tranquilizers. This will halve the speed of the limit bar (colors it blue),
  but the plus side is that your characters take ~30% less damage!

Take note of:
-ê
o Equipment will more than often increase stats without giving the player any
  indications that it does so. Many weapons don't just increase Strength but
  greatly boost your Magic as well. Some armor also boosts stats.
o Equipment comes with Single and Linked slots. Linked slots are only useful if
  you pair one Support Materia with another Materia, such as Elemental - Fire,
  or Ice - All.
o Weapons and armor can have different growth rates. If a piece of equipment has
  a Normal Growth rate, the Materia attached will gain AP at a regular rate. If
  the piece of equipment has Double or even Triple Growth, then the Materia in
  that weapon grow two to three times as fast.
o On the flipside, some weapons or armor have no Growth at all. This is obvious
  when the piece of equipment has no slots, but it is more difficult to notice
  if it *does* have slots. The game still notes No Growth by 'NOTHING', but you
  can also take a close look at the equipment's slots. If it has a darker hole
  in the middle then the equipment has no Growth. If it has a lighter hole in
  the center then it'll have Normal, Double or Triple growth.

&lt;Perfect Game Notes: Highly Optional&gt;
~êP
You will occasionally see these notes sprinkled through the walkthrough, and
you'll no doubt will wonder why someone would go through all that trouble for
little to no reward at all.

These notes are intended for those who are attempting to maximize their save
game by getting the maximum amount of every item, the best possible stats for
every character, getting all treasure - in other words, they completely tear the
game apart during their playthrough. It's a tough challenge and only recommended
if you've played through the game several times already.

Obviously these notes are highly optional and not required during a regular
playthrough. You'll find that the walkthrough is perfectly crafted to find
everything else without needing the information in these Perfect Game Notes.

Please decide beforehand if you want to do your perfect game *with* or *without*
using tricks such as the W-Item trick, the Extended W-Item trick, or the
repeating boss trick. You can find more information about these tricks in 
section {AP-4}.

After the epic introduction you can control our spikey-haired main character.
Before anything, search the body of the first knocked-down guard twice to find
two Potions.

Note: You can actually grab these two Potions from either guard, or two from one
 êof the guards. It doesn't matter, since two is all you'll get.

We're assuming you know the controls, which can also be found in the instruction
manual. First-timers would do well to press the select button, which places
cursors all over the screen. These tell you which way to go, and where you are.
Cloud, our main character, gets a big scary finger hanging over his spikey hair
and exits are marked with red triangles. Climbable objects such as ladders are
indicated by green arrows. If you are a first-timer, I suggest you read section
{0} that covers the controls and some basic hints.

Run down the station tracks and two guards initiate a fight. Your regular
attack will easily do them in, so don't waste your MP on these .. MP's. Talk to
your teammates in the next screen and you'll get to rename Cloud (if you feel
like it) and Barret. Keep in mind that you'll never be able to change a 
character's name after selecting it, so choose wisely or simply stick with the
default names.

After the dialog, head north to follow your team members. You'll likely run into
random encounters at this point, so swipe them off your back as you head into
the reactor. Once inside the reactor, talk to Barret who joins your ranks.

Tip: Head into the Menu and select 'Order'. You'll want to select Barret twice,
 êwhich will put him in the back row. Since Barret has a gun-arm, he'll be
 êto hit enemies for the same damage, while only receiving half the damage
 êfrom physical attacks.

Speak with Biggs and Jessie, who'll gladly open the doors for you. A Phoenix
Down can be looted from a box in the southern room, after which you'll have to
talk to Jessie once more to open the elevator doors.

Press the button and exit the elevator again after the dialog between Barret and
Cloud. Follow Jessie downstairs and go through the door. Walk to Jessie for a
quick tutorial on how to climb ladders (which are marked with green triangles,
if you used the SELECT button before). The blue potion lying around is.. well,
it's a Potion. Climb down the second ladder, walk over some pipes, and make your
way to a final ladder.

It is recommended to save your game at the Save Point, which looks like a
rotating quotation mark. Generally, Save Points appear before bosses or other
moments when 'something' is going to happen. Head down to the next screen, grab
the green marble (now formally known as a Restore Materia) and fiddle with the
valve. Looks like it's time for your first boss fight.

After the battle you'll have 10 minutes to escape from the Reactor 'cause it's
going to blow! Go into the menu and equip Barret with the Assault Gun, which is
better than his initial Gatling Gun.

Note: The timer does NOT stop when the menu is brought up. The only time it'll
stop is when you pause the game during a battle.

Backtrack your way to the screen where you left Jessie. She's sitting in a
crouched position on the lower part of the screen. Walk over and free her foot
that got stuck between the metal bars. Simply return to the elevator after this,
ride it up, talk to Jessie and Biggs to open the doors and get the hell out of
the Reactor #01!

Midgar Sector 1:
-ê
Make your way up the stairs after the scenes. You'll come across the flower girl
that we saw in the intro. You can give different responses, and they will affect
a certain scene later in the game. If you wish to follow a guide that deals with
the different outcomes, check out section {M1.6}.

Don't let the electricity freak you out in the next screen. Do something more
productive instead by picking up the Potion near the exit below, then continue
down south.

Shinra Guards will attack you, but you're given a choice: Fight or Run. Be quick
with deciding, or the game will pick the option that you left the cursor on when
the guards reach you.

After the dialog, follow Jessie and jump over the crates. In the train cabin,
talk to Jessie once again and she'll show you how the trains operate in Midgar.
Have a chat with Barret afterwards.

When you depart, walk up to Barret for a rather quick debriefing. After this,
you're finally given a first bit-sized snack of freedom in the game. You can
talk to the train man and you can - which is even more interesting - exit the
screen on the right to fight monsters in the train graveyard.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 1:&gt;
~êP
NOTE: Again I feel I must mention - for those who skip all introductory
 êparagraphs - that these Perfect Game Notes do NOT have to be done in order
 êto complete the game.  This guide can be followed perfectly to ensure that
 êyou don't miss anything, without having to do the instructions in these
 êperfect game notes.  They are only for perfectionists, and they are
 êimplemented in the walkthrough to ease them in this tough challenge.

 êPlease don't feel distracted by these notes if you're not interested in
 êthis challenge and simply use the guide regularly. As for the actual note:

Head to the train graveyard to the right so you can save up money to buy 99 Iron
Bangles. This can take a very long time, however there *is* a way to slightly
speed it up. Mono Drives (the small floating robots) sometimes drop an Ether.
You can sell this for a whopping of 750 gil! Just pray they drop it, because
it's a rather rare drop. It's not recommended to sell any other items you own
because they aren't as profitable. You need to save 15840 gil to buy 99 Iron
Bangles.. but you'll also get 1500 gil from Barret, and you can also find an
Ether as a treasure. You may also want to set the Battle Speed to the maximum in
the menu. This will cut off a few more minutes per hour. Still, expect this to
take a while.
~êP

When you feel like you've had enough fun in the Train Graveyard, follow the rest
of your team to the hideout.

In the next screen, head left like everyone else to proceed with the story.
Otherwise, take a moment and talk to the guy in the upper left corner of the
area to take a look at The Pillar, a large structure that keeps the plate safely
above the slums. Sure is a good thing it's such a solid structure, right?

The hideout is located in a bar called Seventh Heaven. Even through there are
several houses it should be pretty clear which one the hideout is. Talk to
Barret and head inside - we'll go over the other houses later.

Inside the hideout you get to meet (and name) your childhood friend Tifa.
Attempt to go outside after having a little chat with her and Marlene (Barret's
adopted daughter), and Barret will storm inside. Talk to Tifa, then head down.
After a series of scenes you'll receive your salary from Barret: 1500 Gil!

Cloud gets a good night of rest, waking up fresh to depart on a new mission. Go
up and talk to Tifa and Barret. You can choose to take a Materia Tutorial (by
having Cloud explain this to Barret). If you're not familiar with the Materia
system we suggest you follow this tutorial.

Exit the Seventh Heaven and go inside the building on the lower right. There's a
weapon shop here that sells Iron Bangles - a better piece of equipment than the
Bronze Bangle. Buy 3 of them and equip them on all your party members. The shop
doesn't offer much of interest other than the Iron Bangles; You already have an
Assault Gun for Barret and the Grenade is a fairly weak battle item that causes
mild damage.

Should you need an Inn (if you've been training at the train graveyard), talk to
the kid and offer him the minimum of 10 Gil. He'll then allow you to use his
room all the way upstairs for power-naps.

When you head up to the second floor, enter a room known as 'The Beginner's
Hall'. This place can teach you a lot of basic information on the game, and if
you aren't familiar with the subjects it might do you good to glance over them.
Talk to the dog for general information and to the man to get a list of things
you can choose from. Pick up the blue All Materia on the right, as well as the
Ether in the chest that drops down. You can also talk to the guys on the crates
to learn everything related to battles.

The third floor only houses the boy's room (Inn), so pay a visit to the building
on the lower left instead, which is the local Item/Materia store. You don't have
the Fire Materia yet, so it would make an excellent addition to your arsenal.
The other Materia are copies of those you already own, so it's best not to spend
any gil on them right now. As for items, an extra Phoenix Down never killed
anyone and it doesn't hurt to buy two Antidotes either. If you're got any Ethers
left we suggest you sell the majority of your stock as they sell for a whopping
of 750 Gil. Needless to say, this is a lot of money at this stage of the game.

We suggest you pair the Lightning Materia with newly acquired All Materia in
Cloud's equipment, and give Tifa and Barret your remaining Materia. You've now
explored all places of interest except the house to the north. This is the home
of a fellow named Johnny, who used to be a childhood friend of Tifa and Cloud.
When you're ready, hop on the train to initiate the next bombing mission!

Once inside the train, talk to Tifa. What the...! The alarm goes off! You're
only given 15 seconds to rush to the next cabin, but you still might want to
talk to the guy sitting on the right in the back during the alarm. He'll give
you a Phoenix Down out of appreciation. When you make it to the second cabin,
another timer starts counting down. If you manage to speak with the man on the
lower left you'll be rewarded with a Hi-potion if you tell him 'Yeah'. The third
cabin has a nasty surprise for you: As you rush through it, a pickpocket will
steal an item from you (usually a Potion or Phoenix Down). Quickly run back and
speak with him, telling him 'That's Right' - the bottom option - to get the
stolen item back. Head for the exit and leave the train in the last cabin.

Note: If the team gets caught by failing to make it to the next cabin within the
 êtime limit, nothing serious happens. You'll find that it's a much longer
 êwalk through the winding tunnels until you reach the reactor.

You are now in a winding tunnel. The reactor is located to the north, but it's
possible to go down five screens (when you didn't get caught) to find a guarded
door where you can battle Special Combatants that endlessly spawn. It's not an
excellent training spot, and if you feel the need, training is best done through
random encounters in the winding tunnel.

'Hey you! Slow Down!': The Grashstrike enemy (The green bug-like creatures that
often use an attack called Silk - which slows the affected character) will
sometimes drop an interesting item called Spider Web. This item casts Slow on
all enemies, which is interesting to know because Slow works on many bosses. If
you feel like it, try and get a few of these as you won't be able to cast Slow
for a really long time. The chance this item is dropped is about 4.7% per
Grashstrike. Since they tend to come in large groups, the chance per battle is
higher.

When you reach the green laser beams, crawl through the ventilation shaft on the
left side of the tunnel. Barret is kind of big, so the shaft freaks him out.
Keep in mind that it's not possible to ever head back to the tunnels once you
crawl down the shaft.

Grab the Ether and climb down two ladders. In this enormous looking area,
simply climb the long ladder nearby your left. Note that Wedge is on the lookout
in this area as well - say 'hi' if you like - he's located on the left of the
long ladder.

Crawl through another shaft to get to an area with Jessie. Have a quick chat and
grab the slightly concealed Potion on the left. You can ignore the ladder to the
right, which only leads back to the large area. The one on the left brings you
to a catwalk with Biggs, a Tent and a Save Point. As you climb through the hole
you're finally inside Reactor #05.

Things should look awfully familiar from this point onward. Head to the core of
the reactor just like you did in the previous one, and plant the bomb. Backtrack
to the elevator and ride it up. The chest in the next area holds an Ether (or in
other words, 750 Gil). The device on the upper left opens the door, but all
three buttons must be pressed at the same time. Barret and Tifa will always push
the buttons simultaneously, and you need to do the same. Timing is everything!

It might be a good idea to make use of the Save Point after opening the door,
because it's about time for another boss battle - this time with Boss Music!
Guitars!

|Strategy: This is the only boss battle with a side attack formation. Cloud is |
|on one side of Air Buster while Barret and Tifa are on the opposite side. This|

|damage when attacked in the back. Time your Limit Breaks well and they can do |

|Air Buster knows two executive programs, Program 1 &amp; 2 Operation. In P1 it ê|

Talk to the flower girl and input her name - Aeris. Looks like Cloud fell right
through the church roof! The couple chats for a bit and Cloud agrees to be
Aeris' bodyguard in return for a date. At the same time, Reno from the Turks
steps inside the church with the intention to kidnap Aeris. Make a run for it!

Note: Aeris is placed in the back row by default, which effectively halves all
 êher physical attacks. You can place her in the front row and give her the
 ênewly acquired Titan Bangle you received from Air Buster's battle spoils
 êto compensate the loss of defense slightly. You might also want to slap
 êthe Restore Materia in one of her slots, if you know what I mean.

As you make your way upstairs, Aeris falls down and is chased by the Shinra
Soldiers. Cloud can tell her to fight, run, or to hold on. This last option
allows you push one of the barrels upstairs to dispose of the Shinra soldiers.

All you need to do is push the barrels in the right order: The leftmost first,
the upper barrel second, and the rightmost barrel last. Don't wait too long with
pushing a barrel or Aeris is forced into battle. With her and Cloud rejoined,
exit the church by the hole through the roof.

You'll find yourself in the Sector 5 Slums with a Save Point nearby.  Be aware
of the random encounters in this area, as there are enemies here called Vice
which can steal your equipment. Make sure you kill these thugs as quickly as
possible. The road to Sector 6 (accessed through a hole in the wall on the very
left) is blocked for now, so head up to visit the shopping center of the Sector
5 Slums.

The nearby tube contains a sick guy that really 'are sick fo sho', and he's got
the number #2 tattooed on his arm. It's almost as if someone has been using this
guy to experiment on, wouldn't you think?

The big house in the middle houses two shops: The Materia shop is located on the
left, but it doesn't sell anything new. The Item shop is on the right, which
doesn't sell much worthwhile either. Should you need any Potions, Phoenix
Downs, Antidotes or Tents, this is your haven.

Then there's the door on the far right. Enter and head upstairs. Read the flyer
on the wall, which is the 'Turtles Paradise Flyer No. 1'. These flyers are part
of a sidequest that you can activate much later on in the game. Talk to the
snoring kid and check the locker. Open the hidden drawer, but do NOT take the 5
Gil. If you don't take this now, you'll get a much better reward later.

Lastly, the bus on the upper right part of the screen represents the local
weapon store. If you can afford it, buy 3 Titan Bangles and exit the area on the
right.

Check the beautiful garden before entering Aeris' house in order to collect an
Ether and the Cover Materia. Feel free to make use of the Save Point as well.

Tip: The Cover Materia will have the equipped character protect other members
 êfrom physical attacks. It works best to equip the Cover Materia on someone
 êplaced in the back row (who takes half the damage of physical attacks).
 êTherefore, long range characters such as Barret are ideally given the Cover
 êMateria since they're usually in the back row.

After meeting Elmyra, head upstairs to rest. Since Sector 6 is such a dangerous
area it is probably better to leave Aeris out of your problems and go by
yourself, right? When Cloud wakes up, grab the Potion and Phoenix down near the
bed and WALK near the ledge of the stairs to go down. If you only run for an
instant, Aeris will discover that you're awake and she won't let you leave. Once
downstairs, exit the area and backtrack to the hole in the wall that used to be
blocked.êonly to meet up with Aeris anyhow.

Make your way through Sector 6 until you reach a playground. Cloud and Aeris
spot Tifa on the back of a Chocobo cart and set out to search for her. The cart
was headed for Wall Market, so Tifa is likely to be around there .. somewhere.

Wall Market is quite a big stressful town, so it's a good thing the reggae beat
keeps us at ease. Where could Tifa be at? Inquire at the Honey Bee Inn located
on the lower right of the area to learn that Tifa is likely to be in a place
called Don Corneo's mansion. It sounds like Tifa's been dragged into some sort
of bordel business, which of course can never be good. At least, not for Tifa
anyway!

Head to the far north end of Wall Market and enter Don Corneo's mansion.
Apparently the Don has a strict policy that only girls are allowed to enter.
Aeris is about to rush in on her own before Cloud wisely stops her. She can't go
in all by herself! So .. just how can Cloud enter the mansion alongside Aeris..?
There's only one option .. Cloud has to dress up like a girl!

Note: You can buy Mythril Armlets from the Weapon Store, which is a better piece
 êof defense than what you currently have as equipment.

Exit the mansion and head back to the first area of Wall Market. Enter the dress
shop on the immediate left and talk to the person behind the counter. It appears
that the owner of the dress shop can be found at the bar (up north). Inside the
bar, talk to the guy sitting nearby the entrance. Depending on your choice,
he'll make you a different kind of dress.

Soft + Shimmers = Silk Dress (Best Dress)
Soft + Shiny = Satin Dress
Clean = Cotton Dress

Note: Don Corneo can choose Tifa, Aeris or Cloud as his bride for the night.
 êDepending on how Cloud looks you can influence his decision. Initially,
 êTifa is always chosen as bride, but by getting better dress items it is
 êpossible to have Aeris or Cloud get picked by the Don.

Looks like Cloud will also need a wig to mess up that spiky hair of his. Head
back to the dress store to confirm this and head straight to the gym afterwards,
which is located at the northern part of Wall Market.

Speak with Big Bro and you'll roll into a squat challenge. The controls are
explained to you in game: Make sure you don't tap too fast nor too slow, and
make sure you only tap the next button when Cloud has stopped moving or he'll
scratch his head, thus wasting precious time. Your opponent usually has 17
squats, so try and beat that figure. Depending on how you do, you're rewarded
with a wig:

Winning will get you: Blonde Wig. (Best Wig)
A Tie will get you: Dyed Wig.
Losing will get you: Wig.

You'll actually have obtained all mandatory dress items at this point. However,
do you really think the Don will find Cloud an attractive woman? There's most
certainly room for improvement, don't you think?

Either skip the next few paragraphs if you want to continue with the story, or
follow them anyway to witness a couple of hilarious scenes and obtain more Key
Items.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 2:&gt;
~êP
It's not possible to get all Key Items in Wall Market. For a Perfect Game, it
makes sense to go for the best possible combination: Silk Dress, Blonde Wig,
Sexy Cologne and Diamond Tiara. Also get the Member's Card and the Bikini
Briefs (see mechanics for an explanation why it is technically the best). Have
Cloud put on some make-up just to make him a picture perfect.

Remember that the Phoenix Down (located in the room of the Don's Lackeys, which
is only accessed initially when Cloud is *not* chosen) can be gotten later on
when you revisit Don Corneo's mansion.
~êP

After getting the Wig it's time to get a cologne of some sorts. Head to the bar
and talk to the woman in the toilet. Looks like she could use some medicine.
Head over to the restaurant (left of the Save Point) and order a meal; Either
the Korean B.B.Q. Plate, Sushi Plate, or Today's Special. They all cost 70 gil.
Be sure to answer with &quot;It was alright&quot;, or you won't get the Key Item 'Pharmacy
Coupon' that you'll want.

Head over to the Item Shop. You can select Disinfectant, Deodorant, or Digestive
here for the Coupon. Choose Digestive and give it to the woman on the toilet in
the bar. Depending on what you gave her, she'll give you this in return:

Digestive = Sexy Cologne (Best Cologne)
Deodorant = Flower Cologne
Disinfectant = Cologne

How do you think Cloud looks right now - pretty good for a she-male? We need
something to top it off.. a Tiara! Head over to the Materia Shop, which is north
from the Save Point. The owner is interested in what the vending machine at the
Inn has for sale. Agree to help him out and stay at the Inn near the south
entrance (this costs 10 Gil). In the middle of the night, Cloud'll have the
option to buy something from the vending machine for either 50, 100 or 200 Gil.
The more expensive the better. Head back to the Materia Shop owner and show him
what you got.

200 gil = Diamond Tiara (Best Tiara)
100 gil = Ruby Tiara
50 gil  = Glass Tiara

That's more like it! But .. Cloud may look like a prom queen but he's still
missing underwear and make up. Hmm, just how to fix that? Head all the way south
and talk to the guy on the lower right. He'll give you his 'Member's Card' for</span><span id="faqspan-2">
the Honeybee Inn, no questions asked. We might as well sneak in the Honeybee Inn
to see if Cloud can acquire some undies somehow.

Inside the Honeybee Inn, talk to the girl and choose a room. The Lover's Room
(upper right) and the Queen's Room (lower right) are both occupied, but you can
take a peek through the keyhole to view a scene. Move your view through the
keyhole slightly.. what the ... Okay, nevermind! Let's move on! The &amp;$#% Room
(Upper Left) will acquire you Lingerie, and the Group Room (Lower Left) lets you
walk away with Bikini Briefs. We're not about to spoil the adventures of Cloud
and Mukki for you (or any weird scene whatsoever), so choose your pick, sit back
and relax .. Enjoy the show.ê I'm getting carried away now.ê

After either room/scene, head to the upper room and have the left girl put some
make-up on Cloud (see below for the effects). He looks gorgeous now, doesn't he?

The following mechanics summarize who is chosen:

Make sure you stop by the dress shop to change Cloud's identity and head over to
the Don's mansion. Head upstairs and make your way down the basement on the left
where you'll find Tifa. Don't miss the Ether lying around in the basement.

Now, depending on who's chosen, you'll either find yourself in a room with horny
lackeys of the Don, or in Don's bedroom with a horny Corneo. We'd say both are
equally disgusting. If you're with the lackeys, just talk to all of them and
grab the Phoenix Down. Cloud will reveal he's a guy and kick some lackey butt.
Head through the middle door in the main hall and slip into Corneo's bedroom.

In Don's bedroom, be sure to get the well hidden Hyper behind the bed. If Cloud
got chosen, you'll be able to get the Phoenix Down from the other room some
other time. After the team gets the information they needed from the Don (by
effectively threatening his precious pair), Corneo plays his trump card and the
team falls down the sewers regardless of their answer.

Trivia: 'Corneo' means 'horny' in Italian (or Spanish, or several other neolatin
 êlanguages), and (depending on the context) can also mean horny in a
 êliteral way. In other words, it would then describe an abstract form, as
 êif to say, &quot;That Behemoth's Horn has a horny form, don't you think?&quot;.
 ê[Please do note that we're not talking about a horny Behemoth here,
 êbecause that would make the meaning of its horn more ambiguous than is
 ênecessary, and would overcomplicate this explication. Only the sight
 êwould be enough to terrify me.]  It's up to you to decide if Don Corneo
 êis named for his hornyness or his .. &quot;horny-ness&quot;.  And then it's still
 êan undecided matter whether he's a cuckold in a vulgar sense, or whether
 êhe - more specifically, a certain body part of his - actually has .. 
 ê&quot;horny-ness&quot;.  Square Enix, could you elaborate!?

Grab the Potion before talking to Aeris and Tifa and head into the menu to equip
Tifa with better equipment. Be sure to give one of your characters the Fire
Materia. Moments after both girls get up, Corneo's sewer pet Aps shows up with
the intention to return the team to the planet.

| ê	Tail Attack ê[1 Enemy, Phys Atk, 77.5 Base Damage] ê|
|-êN|
|Strategy: Aps may look like a tough boss, but he actually has a fair amount of|
|weaknesses you can exploit. Aps is particularly vulnerable to Fire, so have   |
|one of your characters cast this at all times to maintain a steady rate of ê|
|damage. Ice and Bolt are still likely to inflict more damage than regular ê|
|physical attacks, making them decent alternatives. ê|
| êN|
|Aps is weak against the Paralysed status. If Aeris happens to already have ê|
|learned her Seal Evil Limit Break, don't hesitate to use this and gain a few  |
|free turns as Aps is sealed in a paralyzing state. Similarly, Cloud's Limit   |
|Break Cross-slash can also paralyse Aps. ê&|
| êN|
|Perhaps one of the weirdest bosses in the game, Aps actually damages himself  |
|with his most powerful attack Sewer Tsunami. This attack can come from either |
|side, dealing front/back damage to Aps and the party. When the attack hits ê|
|the party from the back it helps a great deal to use Aeris' Healing Wind Limit|
|Break when it becomes available. Using Cure and a few Potions is an ê|
|alternative option. ê;|
| êN|
|Technically it's possible to poison Aps by throwing a Deadly Waste item at him|
|if you've gotten this earlier in the game (as a dropped item from a random ê|
|battle in the Reactor #05), but you might as well save it for later. ê
|
'-êN'

Trivia: Aps is presumably named (and/or mistranslated) after Abzu, one of the
 êprimeval gods in the Babylonian creation epic Enuma Elis, and was made
 êof fresh water.  He was the lover of Tiamat, an other primal deity that
 êwas made of salt water.  Incidentally Tiamat is not officially in Final
 êFantasy VII, although Aps does have a buddy you'll meet much later in
 êthe game.

After beating Aps, make your way through the sewers by climbing the ladders up
and down, and make sure you grab and equip the yellow orb: The Steal Materia.
The character with the highest Level has the best chance to steal items (even
though this only makes a marginal difference at this point). Jump down the hole,
head over to the other side and climb the ladder up to the train graveyard.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 3:&gt;
~êP
Depending on what type of perfect game you're doing, you might be here for a
while to steal 99 Ghost Hand's from Ghosts. If you're planning on doing the
W-Item trick later in the game (which allows you to duplicate items), you'll
only need one copy.

Note: It is still possible to get Ghost Hands in the Battle Square of the Gold
Saucer, but ONLY before you get the airship. After that moment, the Ghosts will
permanently disappear from the Battle Square and Ghost Hands can no longer be
acquired. Get some now and save yourself the stress!
~êP

The Train Graveyard houses many items, and we're not just talking about treasure
that you find in the field. The random encounters can turn out to be quite
rewarding as well: You can steal Ethers from Deenglows (the flying, pink-winged,
oversized dragonflies) and as you know by now, Ethers sell for 750 Gil a piece.
You might want to stock up on Ethers and never kill a Deenglow before stealing
from them.

Then there's the Ghost enemy from which you can steal a Ghost Hand. This is an
item that drains MP out of your opponent and gives it to you. While it's not
particularly useful, it is a fairly rare item and you might as well steal a few
while you're here anyway.

The last item of interest is the Graviball, which can be won from Deenglows. It
casts Demi, a spell that deals 1/4th of an enemy's HP if they're not immune to
Gravity based spells. Make *sure* you get a few of these, as they can help a lot
with getting a very powerful skill early in the game.

Note: You can only win an item from enemies if you didn't successfully steal
 êfrom them. In this case, if you steal Ethers, you won't win a Graviball.

There's a Save Point here, so that allows the usage of a Tent. Head inside the
first train and walk out of it - check the barrel to find an Hi-Potion. Now head
back and climb over the train by climbing the ladder. Grab another Hi-Potion
and inspect the barrel on the upper left side of the screen to find an Echo
Screen.

Enter the train on the right and grab the Potion inside, after which you can
exit the train on the lower right side. Climb the nearby ladder and make your
way to the next screen - grab one final Potion before exiting the area.

Tip: In this area, keep your eyes out for a creature named Eligor. It appears
 êalone and looks like a cybernetic centaur. It's definitely stronger than
 êthe regular enemies and you can steal the Striking Staff from it, a GREAT
 êweapon for Aeris at this point of the game. This staff has at least 16 more
 êattack power than the weapon she currently has equipped, so we suggest you
 êtake your time to steal this weapon from Eligor. This will usually take a
 êhefty amount of attempts, but the reward is sweet. The chance of
 êencountering Eligor is roughly 23.4% in this section of the train
 êgraveyard. It cannot be encountered in the southern section.

Snatch the Potion on the left and loot the left-most barrel to find an Ether.
Hop into the brownish train on the right to move the other train out of the way.
Finish the job by also hopping in the upper train. You can now climb the ladder
and grab the Hi-Potion. Walk over the train you moved and exit the place by the
left. When the team reaches the pillar, it doesn't take them long to realize
something is horribly wrong. AVALANCHE is fighting Shinra in the pillar!

Tifa asks Aeris to look after Marlene while she joins Cloud to help Barret.
Feel free to use the Save Point and prepare for a fairly long climb with random
encounters along the way. When you reach Barret, access the menu to tweak in
some last modifications before the next boss battle starts. Give Barret a
Materia with which he can attack, such as Fire, and give him a Mythril Armlet if
you have any spares left. Reno from the Turks makes his entry and isn't about to
let you fiddle with the explosives he just activated.

|-êN|
|Strategy: Reno doesn't have much HP, but he knows an attack called Pyramid ê|
|which favors him in battle. This unique attack imprisons a character in a ê|
|pyramid, during which this character cannot act. The only remedy is to hit the|
|imprisoned character with a physical attack to destroy the pyramid. ê|
| êN|
|Besides his Pyramid attack, Reno uses his Short Staff and Electro-mag Rod ê|
|attacks on the team. Both are weak attacks and pose little threat if you keep |
|your HP above 150. Pummel Reno with Fire, Ice and physical attacks until he   |
|bails - a wise decision, considering the pillar is about the explode! ê	|

Trivia: During the end of the FMV, President Shinra is listening to an existing
 êpiece of classical music.  It's &quot;The Creation&quot; from Franz Joseph Haydn.

The team barely manages to escape Sector 7 with sheer luck, and eventually the
team finds themselves back in Sector 6. Tifa manages to calm Barret down by
telling him that Marlene is probably safe. Best to double check at Aeris' place!

Cloud quickly departs, but Barret and Tifa join him shortly after. Head back to
the playground and pick up the yellow Sense Materia. This allows you to check on
enemy statistics in battle - something this guide will help you with as well.

Backtrack to Aeris' House by making your way through the slums of Sector 6. When
you get to Sector 5, attempt to steal a Speed Drink from the Vice enemies. This
item puts a character in Haste status - it's a fairly decent addition to have
this early on.

Remember the house with the sleeping kid in which you checked the drawers for
5 Gil? In this rightmost house the kid will offer you a Turbo Ether if you
didn't steal his 5 Gil earlier. Not too shabby!

When you arrive at Aeris' house the team finds that Marlene is safe and sound
with Elmyra. Unfortunately, Aeris was captured by Shinra. There's no other way
but to infiltrate the Shinra Building and free Aeris. Head upstairs and talk to
Barret to progress the game. Should you have the need to rest, use the bed on
the left before departing for Wall Market.

Not much has changed at Wall Market besides a few minor things. You can no
longer access the Honeybee Inn after causing all that commotion, but you'll find
that the Materia Shop has re-opened.

Go to the weapon shop and talk to the guy on the left. Looks like he found and
fixed three Batteries which he is selling for 100 Gil a piece. You need these
to progress, so go ahead and make the purchase.

If you hadn't gotten the Phoenix Down in the lackey room at Corneo's Mansion, do
so now. You can also squeeze some information out of Kotch who is tied up in the
basement. Lastly, if you had forgotten the Hyper behind Corneo's bed, go get it
now.

When you're done exploring, head outside and go right of the mansion to climb
a rope that fell down after Sector 7 was destroyed. The team can use this to
reach upper Midgar and reach the Shinra Building. Climb all the way up until you
get to a socket in which you need to fit the first battery. The battery doesn't
last very long, but the propeller now functions as a bridge, allowing you to
continue. The second socket powers a barricade that creates another bridge.
Before you swing over to the other side with the swinging bar, climb up to find
an optional battery socket. Using the battery reveals an Ether, but you might
want to read the note below.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 4:&gt;
~êP
The last battery is a unique item whereas the Ether is a replaceable item with
little value later in the game. Your choice reflects a dilemma of some sorts
with on the one hand a perfect game that features 'getting all treasure' and on
the other hand 'making your inventory as complete as possible'.

Arguably one can reason that you *could've* gotten the Ether but instead chose
the battery because of its uniqueness. This means you can choose to ignore the
Ether and instead keep the rare battery.
~êP

One of the last obstacles is a swinging bar - time your jump well to cling on
to swing over the gap. Climb all the way to the top and the team reaches the
Shinra Building. Time for a battle pose!

Barret is in for some action, but Tifa prefers a more sneaky route. You're given
the choice of entering through the front entrance or by sneaking around the back
and take the stairs. If you take the stairs, walk around the building and skip
ahead to the paragraph of the 59th floor.

Note: If you take the stairs you'll get no random encounters along the way, and
 êthe fifth set of stairs features an Elixir. If you thought you could just
 êgrab this treasure by going in through the front entrance, and backtrack
 êto the stairs then you'll still have to travel through five screens of
 êstairs - there's no quick way of obtaining it.

As you bust in, dispatch the group of Grenade Combatants and head to the back of
the first floor. Here, check the news bulletin in the right corner and read the
Turtle's Paradise Flyer No. 2. This is the rarest of the flyers, and you only
get two chances in the entire game to read it, this being the first. The second
floor features a shop and two closed treasure chests (which can only be opened
during a later visit), so you might as well hop on the elevator.

The elevator has its own unique battle mechanics ê.-ê.-ê.
and you always start out on floor 6. When Cloud ê|Chance:|## Floors Higher:|

When you reach the 59th floor, approach the Shinra guards and dispatch the three
Mighty Grunts. Cloud will pick up the Keycard 60, which grants access all the
way up to floor 60. It is now possible to use this elevator whenever you like.

The 60th floor is basically a security center. Head into the room on the left
and prepare to cross the room to reach the stairwell on the right. To do so,
Cloud must hide behind the golden statues and make a run to the next whenever
the guards look away. Move Barret and Tifa with the circle button when Cloud
reaches the middle, and after he makes it to the stairs. Be warned that the
second part is slightly trickier because the guards run instead of walk. If you
get caught you'll have to try again.

Note: If your timing is particularly poor and you fail five times, the game will
 êlet you pass. The team has probably wiped out all guards on the security
 êfloor at that point.

On the 61st floor, talk to one of the guys walking around the lower part of the
screen and answer with &quot;.ê&quot; and guess what? You'll get the Keycard 62, no
questions asked! There's nothing else to do on this floor other than talking to
the rest of the NPC's.

Head up to the 62nd floor. This is the library and also the floor where
'Mayor' Domino has an office. He's in the room on the left, so pay him a visit.
Looks like the mayor loathes Shinra as much as the team does, so he offers them
his keycard if they guess the password correctly. He'll even throw in an extra
prize if you get it right on the first try.

Now.. Guessing the password to get the keycard isn't difficult, but getting the
best prize (a unique Elemental Materia), that's a little harder. Getting this
Materia is also crucial to optionally acquiring a powerful spell later on.

There are various ways to guess the correct password, and Domino's assistant
Hart hands out hints for a price. You can pay him 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and
even 15000 gil for hints, but we urge you not to do this as we've assembled the
three best methods for guessing the password. Method 1 is the longest method,
but if you like puzzles then it's arguably the most fun. Methods 2 and 3 are
tricks to guess the password instantly.

Method 1
-ê êLower Left: Urban Dev. Research Library
There are 4 different sections in  .-ê+.
the library. The lower left is the |Midgar City map: Sectors 5-8 ê|
'Urban Dev. Research Library'. In  |Reactor Construction Chart ê|
this section, the following files  |Problems with Plate construction in Midgar |

ones that the section should ê|Diminishing Mako energy and Planet movements |
normally have: ê|Results of the failed space mission &quot;YA-79&quot;  |
 ê!|Economic report: Space Dev Program ê|
 ê!|Shinra rocket space travel ê|
 ê!'-ê-'

You'll notice that there is one file in each section that doesn't belong there.
Use the tables to figure out the correct placements of files. When a file
doesn't belong in a certain section, check the number in front of it. This
number indicates which letter of the file is used in the password. For example,
with the file 'Shinra rocket space travel' with the number 15, the letter A is
used in the password. Spaces don't count, only letters and characters do. Check
all four the sections, and you'll get four letters. These letters should form
one of the words the Mayor lets you pick out of: BEST, KING, ORBS, BOMB, MAKO,
HOJO. The answer is *never* ORBS or HOJO.

Method 2
-ê
This method makes your life a lot easier. Walk to the upper right room, also
known as the 'Space Dev. Research Library', which has a blue floor and green
shelves. Check the file on the LEFT of the MIDDLE shelf and consult the table
below for the password.

 ê.-ê*.-ê.
 ê|If the file is this: ê|Then password is: |
 ê|-ê*|-ê|
 ê|2 Economic report: Space Dev Program ê| êBEST ê|

 ê|1 Breakdown of SOLDIER members by class   | êBOMB ê|
 ê|10 New plans for urban planning ê| êMAKO ê|
 ê'-ê*'-ê'

Method 3
-ê
An alternative trick to solve the puzzle is (once you've entered the 62nd
floor) to head down to the bottom floor with the elevator, go outside and save
your game. Head back up to the 62nd floor and try all passwords until you get
the right one. Memorize the password, load up your save game and voila! The
password stays the same if you use this method.

With the Keycard 65, head up to the 63rd floor. This is an optional floor, but
you can collect three treasures if you take the time to solve a puzzle. Walk to
the computer in the lower right room to grant you access to open up three doors
in total on this floor.

To get all items you must open up the right combination of doors. Walk all the
way up around the right and go left. The door that blocks the hall to the left
is the first one you should open up. Continue left, ignoring the first door
below, but open the *second* door below. Grab the 'A Coupon' from the room to
the left and enter the air duct. Crawl to the end on the top of the screen, and
grab the 'B Coupon' from the room you land in. Now just walk out the room, turn
left, open the door and grab the 'C Coupon' from the room. Crawl back in the air
duct and exit by the right.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 5:&gt;
~êP
Don't exchange the Coupons for the items. While the items can be acquired
through other means later in the game, the Coupons are one of a kind and will be
lost forever to you. While you could regard this as another dilemma, similar to
when you had to choose between the Battery and the Ether, the same principle
applies here. Are you going for a complete inventory, or do you want to grab all
the treasure in the game (which no one will ever be able to check).
~êP

The computer can change the coupons you found for the following items:

A Coupon = Star Pendant
B Coupon = Four Slots
C Coupon = 'All' Materia

The Four Slots has - well, it's got 4 slots but has a poor defense rating so we
advise not to use it. The Star Pendant is your first accessory and it protects
against Poison. You might as well equip it on Cloud.

The 64th floor is a recreational area with a fitness room, relaxation room and
everything along those lines. There's a vending machine in the upper left corner
of the fitness room which sells a 'Shinra Gym Special Drink' for 250 gil. Pay up
and choose to bang on the machine. An employee will stop Cloud's bashing, but
you can revisit this area later to claim a reward. Search the locker room to
find a Phoenix Down, an Ether and someone's Ultimate Weapon - but since Cloud
doesn't see any use in holding on to a megaphone, it can't be obtained at this
point.

The 65th floor has random encounters again, although the encounter rate is
fairly low. The idea of the puzzle is to complete the scale model of Midgar with
the Midgar Parts scattered over the area in boxes. The lower chest in the upper
left room holds the first parts. Place them in the model counterclockwise,
starting with the bottom right. Where you place the parts matters for which
chest opens. If you place them like this, the chests will open in the order this
guide describes. Every time that you place the parts in the model, another chest
opens up.

- The second Midgar Parts are found in the lower chest in the lower left room.
- The third Midgar Parts are in the remaining chest in the upper left room.
- The fourth Midgar Parts are in the remaining chest in the lower left room.
- The last Midgar Parts are in the upper right room. After placing the parts,
  the chest near the stairs opens up and you can take the Keycard 66 from it.

The 66th floor is the conference floor where Shinra plans their evil schemes.
Could it be a coincidence that this is based at the 66th floor (a rather evil
number, we think)? Go to the restroom on the upper left of the screen and enter
one of the toilets. After flushing like a gentleman, climb inside the shaft to
eavesdrop on the conference. When the meeting is over, follow Professor Hojo to
the next floor.

Tip: The 67th floor has random encounters, and you can get yourself some good
 êequipment by stealing from Moth Slashers (the robotic enemy on a spinning
 êwheel), and SOLDIER:3rd. The Moth Slashers hold a Carbon Bangle, a great
 êarmor with 27 defense and 3 slots (two of which are paired slots), while
 êyou can steal a Hardedge from any SOLDIER:3rd - a great weapon for Cloud
 êwhich is twice as good as the Buster Sword. You may find the encounter rate
 êfairly low once again, but it's definitely worth the effort.

When you're all done stealing, visit the laboratory on the left to view a scene.
Grab the Poison Materia from the chest, prepare your characters for an upcoming
battle and use the Save Point. Cloud could make good use of the Star Pendant
while Barret is best set up with the Poison - Elemental combination placed in
his armor on *linked slots*. This will protect them from poison attacks. It also
helps to give Cloud the Fire - All, and Barret the Ice - All combination.

When you're all set, ride the lift up to the 68th floor and rescue Aeris from
the dreadful Hojo and his test samples! If you set Barret up for the fight, send
Tifa to look after Aeris.

|-êN|
|Strategy: This boss has the advantage of often being in the back row because  |

|when attacking the boss, so magic should be your primary offensive arsenal.   |
| êN|
|Never use Poison in this battle since H0512 absorbs it - instead use Fire and |
|Ice to damage the boss and it's henchmen. Cloud's Limit Break Cross-slash can |

|with their initial Limit Breaks. ê.|
| êN|
|If Barret already has his Mindblow Limit Break, this can deplete the boss' MP |
|instantly, restricting it to only it's Keyclaw attack. Alternatively, the boss|
|can only revive its henchmen up to a maximum of three times before it runs ê|
|out of MP. Keep your HP high at all times and take good care of your poisoned |
|characters. The boss has only 1000 HP, so a few powerful Limit Breaks should  |
|easily do it in. If you kill the main boss, the henchmen die along. If you do |
|dispatch them separately, you're rewarded with additional Tranquilizers as ê|
|battle spoils. ê@|
'-êN'

After the battle, form a party and grab the Enemy Skill Materia from the sample
cage. Head up the small steps and get the two Potions. Out of fear, the employee
is quick to offer his Keycard 68 to you. Head to the right and snatch two more
Potions along the way. Now head downstairs until you reach the 66th floor's
elevator. Rude and Tseng (from the Turks) catch you off guard and the team is
taken in captivity.

After meeting President Shinra, the team is locked up in the prison cells on the
67th floor. Talk to Tifa, then approach the door and think of your other team
members.

Tip: If you want to date Tifa, talk to her many times and keep answering with
 ê&quot;Leave it to me.&quot;. Otherwise, if you'd rather date someone else, instead
 êpick the other option &quot;Kinda hard.&quot;

What's this? After getting some sleep, the cell door of Cloud's room has been
left wide open, and the guard in the hallway has been killed. What's going on?
After assembling a party, follow Red XIII into the lift and from here on, follow
the trail of blood up to the 70th floor.

That's one big sword sticking out of the president's back, if you know what I
mean. This can only mean one thing: Sephiroth is still alive! The president's
son Rufus is quick to arrive and replace his old man, so you'd better head
outside and pay your respects.

The team splits up and Cloud stays behind to deal with Rufus. You can now choose
to remove Cloud and Tifa's Materia - do this. You'll want to give Aeris the
Lightning Materia and Red XIII at least one other magic materia. Head towards
the elevator and a double boss battle starts.

|opponents in this battle, one after the other. The battle starts with Hundred |

| êN|
|Hundred Gunner has access to a few powerful attacks which can all inflict over|

|1000 HP. êF|

The game flashes back to Cloud, who's about to battle Rufus, the new president
of Shinra Inc. Remove the materia of the others and give Cloud the Poison
Materia. The rest of his setup doesn't matter much.

|Strategy: Focus on Rufus' pet dog Dark Nation first, as it will otherwise cast|

|dispatch the beast right away, but Bio is a good start. ê|
| êN|
|With Dark Nation out of the way, the battle becomes a breeze. Poison Rufus and|
|pummel him with physical attacks. Cloud's Cross-slash can even Paralyse Rufus,|
|but it'll hardly be necessary. Rufus bails in the heat of the battle by ê|
|clinging on to the helicopter. ê0|
'-êN'

After the battle with Rufus, head downstairs and save your game. When Cloud
meets up with Tifa, walk Aeris towards the entrance and the team will make their
escape.

You'll be given the option to form and regroup your party first. Since the next
boss attacks you from the back, make sure that everyone except Barret is in the
back row (this will be inversed in that boss battle). Give Cloud the Lightning
Materia and place an Elemental - Fire combo in his armor. Have one other
character equipped with a Restore - All setup. Lastly, be sure to equip the
accessories Protect Vest and Talisman since they increase defense.

A mini game now commences. You can use square and circle to attack left and
right respectively. Slash the persuading bikers who are mainly after the car
with your the team. The orange bikers are easy targets and you tend to wonder
why Shinra ever hired them. The red bikers probably ponder this as well and
they are a much higher threat. They'll try to lure you away from the truck so
that other bikers can reach and damage the car. Be cautious when you spot a red
biker and try to defeat as many of them as you can. At the end of the track,
another mechanical Shinra creation attacks your team by using its spinning
motor ball. Let's chop that ball off, shall we?

|Strategy: Motor Ball ambushes you and deals about 70 damage to the party. If  |
|you changed the rows of your party then there's no need to swap them manually,|
|otherwise you might want to consider this. ê$|
| êN|
|Keep your party's HP above 250 and attack the boss with Bolt and Ice; You'll  |
|want to avoid Fire-based spells since Motor Ball halves this element. The boss|
|likes to play with fire itself, so if you have someone with the elemental ê|
|protection in their armor, this definitely cuts down on the damage. ê|
| êN|
|While it's possible to slow the boss with a Spider Web item, or even speed up |
|your characters with Speed Drinks, this shouldn't be necessary unless you're  |
|rather underleveled. ê:|
'-êN'

The team leaves Midgar to chase Sephiroth. Make sure to place your characters in
the correct order again after the boss battle, and form a party. As you set foot
on the World Map, the game suddenly gets a whole lot less linear.

You can save your game whenever you like when on the World Map, and you can
thus use Tents anywhere as well.

Tip: Before you head over to Kalm, which is located slightly northeast of
Midgar, take your time to find some Custom Sweepers in the dirt area. These
mechanical enemies use an attack called 'Matra Magic', which you can acquire by
learning it on the Enemy Skill Materia. The character who is equipped with this
Materia needs to be hit by, *and* survive the attack. The battle must then be
won to permanently acquire that skill.

You can also steal Atomic Scissors from Custom Sweepers, a much better weapon
for Barret at this point. Note however that this is one of Barret's few *non*-
long range weapons.

The Prowlers in this area can steal your items in a similar fashion the Vice
could in the Sector 5 Slums. Be extremely careful around these thieves and
always prioritize dispatching them as the first of the bunch. In turn you can
steal Ethers from Prowlers and Kalm Fangs. As you know by now, Ethers sell for
750 Gil a piece.

A visit to Kalm is mandatory; If you attempt to rush onward you'll get stopped
by the time you get to the Mythril Mines. At Kalm, follow the team inside the
Inn and go upstairs, where a long flashback unfolds.

Speak with Sephiroth, explore the town of Nibelheim and stop by Cloud's and
Tifa's houses (on the upper right of town). In Tifa's house, enter her room
upstairs .. and check the drawer to find Orthopedic Underwear. You know it's
true! Make sure you play on her piano as well and tell Tifa that you jammed on
it.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 6:&gt;
~êP
You must play the piano and say 'Yeah, I jammed on it'. Only by choosing this
option can you get a unique Elemental Materia from the piano on Disc 2.
~êP

When you're done exploring, head inside the Inn and talk with Sephiroth
upstairs. After getting some rest, go outside and proceed to explore Mount
Nibel with Tifa as guide. As you follow the linear path of the caves, let
Sephiroth do the fighting; He'll dispatch entire groups of enemies in mere
seconds. You'll reach the reactor eventually and more scenes follow.

As the story continues, Cloud finds himself in the Shinra Mansion. Go upstairs,
enter the right part of the mansion and speak with the Shinra soldier on guard.
There's a secret entrance in this room which leads to the basement. After the
scenes in the basement, Sephiroth goes badass and does horrible things to the
town and it's people. The flashback's conclusion unfolds in the reactor, but was
that all there is to the story?

Back in Kalm, head back upstairs when you're given the chance and inspect the
cabinet left of the stairs five times to acquire the Megalixir. Downstairs
you're given the 'PHS', a mobile cellphone that adds the PHS option to your
menu. This allows you to freely change your party on the World Map and any Save
Points.

Trivia: In case you were wondering just what PHS stands for: It's Party Hensei
 êSystem, and Hensei means editing. A funny thing about the abbreviation
 êof PHS is that it also stands for Personal Handiphone System in Japan,
 êor simply a cellphone!

Head out of the Inn and explore the next house on the right. An Ether is hidden
behind the door under the stairs, and there are no other treasures in this
house. The house in the middle contains an Ether upstairs, which is found in the
cabinet.

Note: The locked treasure chest here cannot be opened. There have been valid
 êrumors that it was part of a sidequest involving dummied-out Key Items
 ê'Letter to a Daughter' and 'Letter to a Wife'. The reward for this quest
 êwas probably the Golem Materia.

In the last house, climb the spiral stairs and grab the Peacemaker from the
chest - this is a weapon for a future character. While taking a peek through the
small window doesn't do anything, it's still neat to know of the possibility.
Go downstairs and head up the other stairs. Check the cabinet left of the girl
to find a Guard Source.

Back at the town square, enter the single house on the right and check the door
below the stairs to find another Ether - it's like a drug to these townspeople!

With the town explored, consider making a stop at one of the stores located on
the northern side of the village. The Item Shop on the left doesn't sell much of
interest, but the Materia Store sells two Materia you don't have yet: Earth and
Heal. While you could purchase a better glove for Tifa at the Weapon Store, you
will soon be able to steal an even more powerful glove for free.

As you set foot on the world map and travel east, remember that the Matra Magic
enemy skill can wipe out most groups of enemies early in the game. Make good use
of it before the spell becomes obsolete!

You'll soon reach *the* Chocobo Ranch, which is hard to miss in the vast eastern
grasslands. As you first enter, speak with the Chocobo and 'Wark' hello. All
Chocobos perform a little dance for you and spit out your very first summon
Materia: Choco/Mog.

Note: The Choco/Mog Materia is your first Summon Materia, and it's a fairly odd
 êone as well because it is two attacks combined in one: There's the
 ê'DeathBlow!!' attack which is very common; This is a non-elemental attack
 êthat has a chance of inflicting Stop on enemies. Secondly, and much rarer
 êwith only a rough chance of 5.86% of appearing is the 'Fat-Chocobo'. This
 ênon-elemental attack is slightly more powerful, but doesn't inflict any
 êstatuses.

Tip: If you pair the Choco/Mog Materia with the Elemental Materia in someone's
 êweapon, this will grant the Wind Element to all their physical attacks.
 êMany enemies are vulnerable to Wind, and as such you'll deal twice as much
 êdamage to them with the character you equipped this combo on. Always keep
 êan eye out for flying or airborne enemies as these are usually susceptible
 êto Wind. As such, it's best to equip this combination on a character who
 êuses Long Range weapons by default, as flying enemies could otherwise be
 êout of reach for characters without the Long Range ability.

Enter the house and talk to the man named Choco Bill. He can tell you just how
dangerous the Marshes are (as we're about to find out) and informs you that he
saw a man in a black cape traveling right through it. The bedroom can be used
to rest at a medium price of 100 Gil.

Inside the stables you'll find Choco Billy - now this guy knows almost
everything there is to know about catching and raising Chocobos. Since he's in a
good mood, he'll sell you the Chocobo Lure for a mere 2000 Gil. It's a two-of-a-
kind Materia, so take the offer and equip it on one of your characters.

You've probably noted the Chocobo tracks on the world map, well, if you've got
the Chocobo Lure Materia equipped you can actually encounter Chocobos in battle.
Before you catch a Chocobo to travel over the Marshes, consider doing a few
optional things first that can really boost your team's power.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 7:&gt;
~êP
If you get the L4 Suicide skill now it will save you a lot of trouble later.
~êP

[Optional: Getting 3 extra Enemy Skills]
~êP
If you don't want to follow these optional notes, skip ahead to catching a
Chocobo and crossing the Marshes with it, and proceed to the Mythril Mines.

L4 Suicide:
-ê
This enemy skill can be gotten from the small mole-like critters named Mu. They
can be fairly uncommon to encounter, and they don't use the attack all that
often either, but it's still not *too* hard to get this skill. Make sure not all
of your characters' levels are divisible by four (Level 12, 16, 20, etc.), or
the attack will cause critical damage [31/32 of HP] and 100% Mini to everyone.

Chocobuckle:
-ê
With the above skill in your possession it is possible to also acquire the skill
Chocobuckle, but this one is a lot harder to get. In order for a Chocobo to use
this skill, it needs to lose 31/32nd of its Max HP and the attack may not fully
deplete its HP. Furthermore, the Chocobo must've eaten either a Sylkis or Mimett
Greens to unlock the possibility of using the skill at all. So, just exactly how
to deal with this?

Buy at least one Mimett Greens from Choco Billy back at the stables and save
your game. Get into a battle with a Chocobo and sense it to check if it's Level
16. If not, try and get another battle with a Chocobo until it is. Then, use the
Mimett Green on it (which unlocks the possibility for the Chocobo to use
Chocobuckle), and quickly cast the L4 Suicide skill; The Chocobo will counter
with Chocobuckle.

Beta:
-ê
This last enemy skill can be gotten from no other than the Midgar Zolom, the
oversized serpent roaming the Marshes. The beast has 4000 HP, its bites inflict
several hundred damage and Beta usually inflicts well over a 1000 points of
damage. How in the world are we going to learn that skill right now?

It takes a little preparation in order to acquire Beta, and there are two
different possibilities. The first requires fighting several battles most likely
while the second should always work.

Strategy 1: Get Aeris into your party and give her an Enemy Skill Materia with
-ê Matra Magic. You'll want to learn her 3-1 Limit Break, Planet
Protector, which puts your party into the peerless status for a short while.
This is the same thing as invulnerability. In the Mythril Mines you'll often
come across enemy groups of 4-5 in one battle. Have Aeris wipe them out with
Matra Magic. After approximately 30 battles she should learn Planet Protector.

Save your game before attempting anything! During the battle with the Midgar
Zolom, keep track of his HP and don't make it fall below 1500. Use Graviballs
(or Poison) to severely chop its HP down. When it draws close to 1500 HP, use
Planet Protector with Aeris, and pummel the snake a little more. It will then
cast Beta (which it casts when it drops below 1500 HP) and with the peerless
status you will survive. Cast Beta right back at it to end the battle
victoriously.

Strategy 2: You MUST have the Elemental Materia in order to proceed with this
-ê strategy. After un-equipping all materia and accessories, check in
the status screen which character has the highest HP and Spirit, and give that
character the Talisman accessory and your best armor (which should be the Carbon
Bangle). Also place the Elemental-Fire combination in the linked slots of that
character's ARMOR. Make sure you've given them the Enemy Skill Materia as well.
Don't equip any other Materia on this character as it'll only lower their HP.

One of your other characters will need the Poison Materia and Choco/Mog, and
hand the Restore Materia to your last member. Carbon Bangles will help you
increase their defense, and all characters should be placed in the back row.

Get into a random encounter and fill up all three character's Limit Break Bars.
Give your characters Tranquilizers to place them under the Sadness status. While
this halves their Limit Break Bar Speed (which doesn't matter much as you just
filled these up), this status also reduces the damage taken from many attacks by
approximately 30.86%. Save your game after this preparation.

In short:
=ê	
1. Fire-Elemental linked in the armor of the character with Enemy Skill.
2. Talisman on character with Enemy Skill.
3. Poison materia on a second character.
4. All characters in back row.
5. All characters in Sadness status.
6. All characters Limit Break Bar full.

During the fight, immediately throw any Graviballs at the Zolom. The first does
a whopping of 1000 damage, the second 750. Make sure you poison the snake after
this and keep track of its HP. It's a good time to use your Limit Breaks when
the poison sticks, and it'll cut down another good portion of life. When its HP
drops below 1500 it will counter with Beta (so when it drops under 1500 due to
poison damage, it won't use Beta). Just make sure you don't attack the Zolom
with the character that comes equipped with the Enemy Skill Materia once the
snake drops near 2000 HP, or it might knock them out of battle.

A surefire way to win the fight and learn Beta is to wait until the poisoned
snake has about 400 HP left (just wait your turns and let the poison do the
talking). When you attack it at this time it will use Beta and immediately die
due to double poison damage.

This is a rather advanced strategy that may require several attempts. Be warned.
~êP
&lt;End of Optional part&gt;

Crossing the Marshes can be done by three means. You can catch a Chocobo, you
can try to outrun the Zolom by foot, or you can battle the Zolom.

Catching a Chocobo:
-ê
Keep walking near the chocobo tracks with a Chocobo Lure Materia equipped and
you'll soon get in a battle with a Chocobo. Feed it one of the greens (Curiel
Greens work best for now as they keep the Chocobo occupied for 5 turns). Kill
the remaining enemies and you'll have caught the Chocobo.

Note: You can also get to the other side of the Marshes by just walking in, save
 êyour game and load your progress. Every time you start the game up the
 êZolom will spawn elsewhere instead of nearby, allowing you to take a few
 êmore steps. We suggest you keep a separate file in case things go horribly
 êwrong, however.. It is also worthwhile to note that you can outrun the
 êZolom when it heads to the far western corner. Experiment a little with
 êthis.

A frightening view awaits the team at the entrance of the Mythril Mines. One of
the mighty Zoloms was ruthlessly shishkebabbed by Sephiroth! Such power cannot
be human..

Mythril Mine:
-ê
The Mythril Mine is a rather small area consisting of only four screens. Head
right and climb the vines on the left to reach a cliff with the Long Range
Materia. This is a very useful Materia as it grants the same ability that long
range weapons give: You can hit anything for full damage regardless of front or
back row. It is best given to a character who does not have the long range
ability already (Barret does), so Cloud would be a candidate. Make sure to place
him in the back row to benefit from the effects.

An Ether and Tent can be acquired from the stone steps. If you're interested in
learning another enemy skill, have one of the Ark Dragons hit the properly
equipped character with their Flame Thrower skill.

Back in the initial mines, keep an eye out for enemies called Madouge (they
swing a ball above their head). You can steal a Grand Glove from them, which is
by far the best weapon for Tifa at this time. Make your way through the cave and
grab the Mind Source from a chest on the lower right of the area.

The team encounters the Turks at the exit of the mines. Elena - apparently a
newcomer amongst the Turks - spoils the direction in which Sephiroth is headed.
At least we know he's going to Junon now! Explore the northern cave to find an
Elixir and a Hi-Potion, then exit the area.

Back on the World Map it is up to you whether you head straight for Junon or do
an optional and well-rewarding side quest at Fort Condor.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 8/Fort Condor Note 1:&gt;
~êP
From now on you can expect to see Fort Condor Battle Notes throughout the guide
to ensure you won't miss any of them. Losing a battle means losing a treasure
at the very last of battles due to the nature of the mechanics behind the prizes
given out at Fort Condor.

While it's possible to obtain an obscure Vagyrisk Claw by battling Cmd. Grand
Horn during one of the first three battles at Fort Condor (which requires to
lose a fight), this isn't recommended as you can obtain these items through an
other method. Losing a Fort Condor battle means you lose a prize.

The prize for the first battle at Fort Condor is a Magic Comb.
~êP

Fort Condor is hard to miss; Just look for a huge condor on top of a blue
reactor. Tell the guard that you're here to help, climb up and inquire about the
situation with the old man at the table. Agree to help them and you're free to
make use of their resources. The shops don't sell anything new, so instead visit
the battlefield overview on the upper left side of Fort Condor.

Talk to the guy in command of the battlefield and he'll tell you how the mini
game works. You also have the option to donate funds, but this isn't necessary.
Tell him you're ready to start the battle.

You can win any Fort Condor battle very easily and very quickly by placing just
one unit (as low as possible on the screen) before starting the battle. As soon
as the battle starts, move the battle speed up to the maximum by pressing R1 and
place a soldier below the other one. Try to place it as low as possible; There's
essentially a red laser line that will mark your territory as you attempt to
place units too low. Repeat this until you can practically place all your units
next to the enemies and secure the bottom area. When all enemies are defeated
before getting help of reinforcements, the battle will be won.

The prize for this first battle is a Magic Comb, a weapon for Red XIII with
Double Materia growth. Any Materia placed in weapons with double growth will
level up twice as fast since they get double the AP gained from battles.

When you're done in Fort Condor, head back to the World Map and travel west.
You can either proceed to Junon now or take the time to meet a potential party
member named Yuffie. She comes with the all-new Throw Materia as added bonus!

Meeting Yuffie:
-ê
You can meet Yuffie in any forest on ê.-ê&.
the World Map, so this is the very first| ê	Junon Area:  32/256 (= 12.5%)|
opportunity to meet her. The forests ê| êGongaga Area:  64/256 (= 25.0%)|
around Junon are also those with the ê| ê	Nibel Area:  64/256 (= 25.0%)|
lowest chance of meeting Yuffie (12.5%),|   Rocket Town Area: 255/256 (= ~100%)|
so it might take a while to run into ê| êWoodlands Area: 128/256 (= 50.0%)|
her. ê$| êMideel Area: 128/256 (= 50.0%)|
 ê(|Goblin/Round Island: 128/256 (= 50.0%)|
 ê('-ê&'

Tip: Before attempting to get Yuffie on your team, consult the date mechanics
 êif you want to date her later!

Defeat the Mystery Ninja and you'll get to an open ê.-ê.
field. Unless you want to solve this on your own (in   |Correct Answers: ê|
which case you should lay this guide aside now), make  |-ê|
sure you *never* take your eyes off Yuffie. This means |&quot;Not Interested&quot; ê|
you can *not* enter the menu or use the save point. To |&quot;.êpetrified&quot; ê|
get her to join, give her the following answers: ê|&quot;Wait a second!&quot; ê|
 ê7|&quot;.êThat's right&quot;  |
You'll get to name her as you leave. Note that if you  |&quot;.êLet's hurry on&quot;|
fail and Yuffie bails on you, she'll steal a random ê'-ê'
amount of Gil from you as well!

Yuffie comes equipped with the Throw Materia that allows you to throw weapons at
enemies (and later on, you'll unlock the Coin command as well, which allows Gil
to be thrown).

Further note that Yuffie also uses long ranged weapons, giving her an advantage
over other characters; Make sure to place her in the back row. If you decide to
use her, take your time to steal a Boomerang from the Formula enemy (the purple
birds). This is a great weapon for Yuffie.

Junon:
-ê
Now head west until you reach the coast. Junon might be tricky to see from
this angle, but the with the size of the cannon attached to this city it
shouldn't take *too* long to find either.

There's not much to do in the harbor of Junon, and the weapon shop only sells
junk. Before you head to the beach, be sure to equip your party well for an
upcoming fight and give Cloud the Long Range Materia. It helps to also give him
the combo Elemental - Choco/Mog in his *weapon*. This adds wind damage to his
sword, allowing to deal twice the damage to the upcoming boss.

After meeting a girl named Priscilla on the beach, a big monster appears.

| ê	Tail Attack [1 Enemy, Phys Atk, 127.5 Base Damage] ê|
|-êN|
|Strategy: Bottomswell can be a decent challenge if you come unprepared. Surely|
|you remember the Pyramid attack from Reno? Bottomswell has a similar attack   |
|that imprisons your character, except there are two differences here. First of|
|all, 'Waterpolo' (as these balls are called) will gradually drain the affected|
|character from their HP like a reversed Regen would do. Secondly, the orb is  |
|destroyed by magic, not physical attacks. There's actually a third minor ê|
|difference as well: You'll have the select the actual Waterpolo orb and *not* |
|the character. Only targeting the orb itself with magic will destroy it. ê|
| êN|
|With that cleared up, the rest of the fight shouldn't be all that hard. If you|
|set one character up with the Elemental - Choco/Mog combo in their weapon, ê|
|then they'll be able to hit for twice as much damage. Graviballs also deal ê|
|decent damage when used at the start of the fight. Of course, if you want to  |
|completely slaughter Bottomswell, a few castings of Beta make short work of   |
|the creature. êA|
| êN|
|Note: Bottomswell actually has three forms through it will dynamically cycle. |
| êSince the forms are difficult to distinguish from each other, we make no|
| êfurther mention of them other than in the attack notes. ê|
'-êN'

With Bottomswell sunk to the bottom of the .. beach, the team still needs to
revive Priscilla while they can. Red XIII would make an excellent candidate, but
Cloud is instead asked to perform the CPR. This minigame is extremely easy if
you know what you're doing. Essentially, Cloud's lungs can fill op to 10
'breaths' per inhale. Cloud will fail to perform CPR if you don't press Square
to exhale as the bar reaches the maximum. Priscilla requires 41 'breaths' to
come back to consciousness, so you can have Cloud breathe up to the 9th breath
for five times in order to revive Priscilla.

Back in the village, talk to the woman in front of the house who offers the team
a place to stay for the night. When Cloud awakens, a mysterious voice tells him
to ask Tifa about Nibelheim five years ago. Follow Tifa outside.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 2:&gt;
~êP
The second Fort Condor battle has an *extremely* short time span, and if you
wish to do it you must do so right now. Don't go to Priscilla but head straight
to Fort Condor with just Cloud as a party member. This makes random encounters
a bit more difficult, so remember to save a few times. The prize for this Fort
Condor battle is a Peace Ring (unless, of course, you missed the first battle,
in which case you receive the previous prize - a Magic Comb).
~êP

In Junon, head over to your party and go upstairs. Priscilla will come outside
and hand Cloud a pendant with the Shiva Materia as a gift for rescuing her.
Head to the beach and talk to Priscilla, who'll give you a whistle to call Mr.
Dolphin whenever you like.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 3:&gt;
~êP
Yes; Right after you get the whistle, just head back to Fort Condor once again
and do the third battle. The time span for this battle is once again rather
small. The prize for this battle is 'three Tincture, which are actually three
Ethers. Tinctures are from FF VI ...
~êP

When you get in the water, Barret takes the PHS from you. To get to the top,
*don't move at all*. Simply blow the whistle twice and Mr. Dolphin jumps you
right to the top.

Cloud climbs up the airport and sees the Highwind for the first time. Make your
way to the barracks and you'll quickly be halted by an officer. Guess you'll
have no choice but to play along and follow the instructions to march in Rufus'
welcoming parade. Follow your captain to an alley and the parading minigame will
start.

Tip: It greatly helps if you set the message dialog speed to default.

Many people have a hard time scoring over 50%, but it's actually very simple.
When you gain control of Cloud, it's best to just run immediately downwards,
straight through the line of soldiers and take the empty spot. Walk to the left
while staying in line. Don't press circle until after the first message/command
appears. After this, simply press the circle button at the end of each message
(&quot;Now&quot;) to make the ratings shoot up.

Note: You *must* have the controller settings set to default in order to 
 êsuccessfully make this work.

Here are the possible prizes:
-ê
&lt;29% ê= Grenade
30%-39%  = 6 Potions
40%-49%  = 6 Ethers
50%+ ê= 5000 Gil

&lt;Perfect Game Note 9:&gt;
~êP
If you're going for a perfect game, it's fair enough to include the best prizes
you can possibly get. In this case, go for the 5000 Gil.
~êP

After the parade you're given another instruction for a send-off later on. Cloud
is best at winning, so the victory stance becomes the finishing move. You're now
given some free time to explore Junon. There are various shops and treasure to
be found, so take your time for a thorough exploration.

The first shop you'll come across is the Materia store, which sells two new
types of the shiny orbs: Seal and Revive. If you've got the money to spare
(which shouldn't be a problem if you've been selling Ethers) we suggest you buy
one of each. Down the alley is a weapon shop that sells decent weapons, although
you probably already have all of the weapons if you've been following our
stealing notes, with the exception of Red's Diamond Pin. You can find Rude of
the Turks chilling in the bar, and other than a casual item store which sells
Hi-Potions, there are no other shops of interest on this side of Junon.

The last door in this area leads to a housing area. Before you head up the
stairs, check out the rather concealed soldier standing near the stairs. He'll
lead you to the Beginner's Hall, and the ghosts of the people stayed behind in
case you needed to know anything else about the game. In all seriousness, this
is a place to ask anything basic regarding the game. Make sure you grab the
Enemy Skill Materia before leaving.

Head upstairs and search the second floor for a 1/35th Soldier, Mind Source and
Luck Source. For your information, the 1/35th Soldiers are nothing but a
collector's item, and there is no reward whatsoever for getting 12, 35, 99, or
whatever other random amount of them - they're simply collectibles. Head up the
third floor and collect the Power Source and Guard Source. Now that you've
explored this side of Junon, head down and follow the path to the other major
sector of Junon (and if you're quick, you'll see a group of people running to
the very end of this area.. Did some of them look .. familiar?).

The first door in this area leads to another bar with the Turks. The second one
leads to an Inn, Materia shop and accessory shop on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors
respectively. Only the accessory shop sells things of interest: Silver Glasses
protect against Darkness and Headband protects from Sleep. If you can spare the
money, buy one of each.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 10:&gt;
~êO
Be sure to get at least one Headband. It will make your life easier soon.
~êO

The third door leads to several rooms. The first room houses a Speed Source and
you can find a 1/35 Soldier on the 2nd floor.

There's one last weapon store in this area, but for the time being it doesn't
sell any new equipment due to a wrong order of the store owner (come back here
on Disc 2). Head for the far end and you'll get to the docking area of cargo
vessels.

It is also here where the send-off for Rufus begins. The commander gives you the
orders, and you follow them by correctly pressing the button (and staying in
line with the other two soldiers). You get 10 points for every correct move,
except turning. You must still face the same direction as the others in order to
get points at all, however. Lastly, your victory pose nets you 30 points.

Note: The captain's commands are completely random. You get the following prizes
 êfor these results:

0-50 Points = Silver Glasses
60-90 Points = HP Plus Materia
100+ Points = Force Stealer

The Force Stealer is a sword for Cloud with double growth and 3 slots. By the
way, you can make Cloud move in mysterious ways when the send-off is over. He'll
do things like scratching his back with his gun, shrug, or touch his hip with
his hands and pose.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 11:&gt;
~êP
For a perfect game, aim for the best prize available - the Force Stealer.
~êP

It is up to you which of the two you prefer: A HP Plus Materia nets you an early
HP bonus, but the Force Stealer is a good sword with double growth. In any case,
quickly hop on the boat before it departs!

On the cargo boat, grab the Ether from the chest to your nearby left. The
character blocking the blue orb - an All Materia - is actually Yuffie who
suffers from heavy motion sickness. You can give her a tranquilizer, but she
won't move until later on. Go upstairs and talk with everyone, especially Tifa,
who's standing on the lookout post. On the deck you can also get your HP/MP
restored (tell him you're tired), or sell you a few basic items.

Talk to the sailor with .. Huh?! With a tail? That must be Red XIII! Head down
and speak with Aeris, who's located on the upper left and dressed as a Shinra
soldier. When she asks where Barret is, head back up on the deck and head to the
front. That's where he is, our little big sailor boy! After the alarm sounds,
head back to the previous screen and form a party. You'll randomly encounter
Shinra enemies in the cargo room now.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 12:&gt;
~êP
This section requires a lot of time and is quite possibly one of the most time
consuming things of the challenge. You must steal 99 Shinra Beta's from Marines,
and yes, that takes a LOT of time. There are some things that speed it up
though: Use L4 Suicide on the Marines at the start of each battle and they'll
be inflicted with the Small status, only dealing 1 damage for the remainder of
the battle. Needless to say, this saves you a lot of healing time.

Equip a Headband on your stealing character (the one with the highest level),
and Silver Glasses on the other(s). Headband will protect against Sleep so you
can keep stealing with that character, and Silver Glasses protect against
Darkness so you can dispatch the Marines of whom you've already stolen.

The Shinra Beta is furthermore a decent piece of equipment which you may want to
equip on your characters.
~êP

Make sure you grab the All Materia that Yuffie was blocking earlier on and head
through the door on the left. First, climb up the ladder and walk over to the
right to get the Wind Slash from the chest - a good weapon for Yuffie with
double growth which we suggest to use. After properly equipping your team,
approach the Shinra officer and watch Sephiroth appear..who leaves Jenova*BIRTH
behind for the team to play with.

|-êN|
|Strategy: Jenova BIRTH has no weaknesses to exploit, other than possibly Slow |
|(with a Spider Web item). Use your Summons, Limits, and Enemy Skills whenever |
|possible. Flame Thrower deals a fair amount of damage, as does Fire and Ice.  |
|Stay away from Poison spells and - if you're using Red XIII - take advantage  |
|of Red's Lunatic High Limit Break if he's learnt it; This puts everyone in ê|
|Haste and greatly increases Red's evasion. ê$|
| êN|
|Jenova*BIRTH will use its Tail Laser rather often, sometimes even multiple ê|
|times in a row. Be quick to counter with a few Hi-Potions or Cure, and Aeris' |
|Healing Wind is always helpful in tricky scenarios. If you don't feel like ê|
|losing, a few casts of Beta will mop the floor with Jenova*BIRTH. ê|
'-êN'

After the fight, immediately grab the Ifrit Materia and leave the boat.

The Cargo Boat arrives at Costa del Sol and sun puts the team in the mood to
celebrate vacation - or at least a short break. Depending on who's in your
current party, various little events happen all over Costa del Sol. These events
are only available during your very first visit.

If Aeris and Tifa are not in your party, they'll head of to tan on the beach.
If Red XIII's not in your party you can kick the soccer ball at him at the town
square! Barret can be found posing in his sailor suit in the bathroom of the Inn
and Yuffie will replace the Materia shop owner if she's not in your party. If
Tifa is in your party and you visit Johnny's new home then you'll get an extra
scene. Lastly, you can find Hojo at the beach - try to squeeze some info out of
him.

As for treasure, you can enter the villa connected to the bridge and visit the
basement to find a Fire Ring, Power Source and Motor Drive here. In case you're
looking for a residence, this villa is actually for sale since President
Shinra's unfortunate demise. The bargain price? 30ê Gil!

You can buy armor from a guy in the left corner of the Costal del Sol bar. The
Platinum Bangle may seem to have a poor defense rating, but it's the first (and
one of two) armor in the game with double Materia growth. We leave the choice of
purchase up to you.

After exploring the town, continue your journey on the World Map and head west/
northwest. Go over the mountain trail and the bridge until you reach Mount
Corel.

Tip: In this entire area, Matra Magic can dispatch most large groups of enemies,
 êmaking it an excellent place to learn new Limit Breaks.

Follow the mountain trail and speak with the old man, who'll tell you he saw a
man in a black cape passing through not too long ago. Continue over the trail,
head past the Corel Reactor and make your way over the train tracks. Use the
Save Point in the next screen and carefully proceed over the tracks. There are a
few weak spots in the tracks, but if you want to grab some treasure, don't press
circle and let Cloud fall down. At this time - while falling down - hold the
left directional button and tap circle as fast as you can. If done correctly,
Cloud will be able to acquire the Wizard Staff as he climbs back up.

At the end of the upper tracks, grab the W Machine Gun from the chest and be on
your way. You'll find that you have two more opportunities to collect treasure
far below the tracks; The item on the right is a Star Pendant. The other two
items in this area are a Turbo Ether and the Transform Materia. Follow the upper
tracks first, and flip the switch in the cabin at the very end of the road to
lower the bridge. If you walk past the cabin, you'll hear birds chirping from
above; Climb the wall to reach a hidden Cockatolis nest. Cloud now faces the
ethical decision whether to take the treasure (10 Phoenix Downs) or not. If you
do take the treasure, you'll have to fight the mother Cockatolis. The little
ones are not harmed whatsoever.

Head back and cross the bridge. Follow the left tracks leading to the water and
enter a hidden cave under the tracks, which is now the home of an unemployed
miner. Grab the Tent, Mind Source and Power Source from around here. 

Tip: As you continue over the enormous bridge, try and steal a few Right Arms
 êfrom Bombs. This is an *extremely powerful* battle item at this point of
 êthe game, and usually inflicts around 1500 damage to all enemies. Needless
 êto say, these can definitely help you tackle a few optional challenges
 êalong the road. After your stealing adventures, finally enter the destroyed
 êtown of North Corel.

Looks like Barret has a history with this town; A man punches him right in the
face while he does nothing to prevent it. What's going on?

The shops in North Corel sell little of interest, although you may want to
purchase a Force Stealer for Cloud at the weapon store if you went with the
HP Plus Materia during the Rufus sendoff back at Junon. There's no need to
purchase any additional copies of Transform, as you'll get another copy soon
enough.

You can find a rather well hidden Ether in the home on the right: You need to
wait until the woman in that house walks to the right. Then, stand next to her
and wait for her to pass you. You can now access the pot in the corner, which
holds the Ether. This is one of the most obscure treasures in FF7, and although
other websites that have been grabbing information from this guide have since
added it, not many people knew about this treasure years ago.

When you're ready, exit to the Ropeway by the lower left path of the area (with
a sign pointing towards the Gold Saucer). Barret gives a brief overview of what
happened many years ago in North Corel, and the team heads off to the Gold
Saucer afterwards.

Note: Optionally, you can also head down the right path to visit a new part
 êof the worldmap. The creatures here aren't particularly special, but there
 êis one exception. There are Chocobo tracks on the east side of the desert
 êsurrounding the Gold Saucer (coming from Mount Corel, the Chocobo tracks
 êare on your far left end of the desert). It's possible to encounter the
 êHarpy enemy here, but only in a Chocobo battle, so you'll have to equip
 êthe Chocobo Lure Materia. It's a fairly powerful foe, so be sure you're
 êfully healed, especially if you want to learn a new Enemy Skill: Aqualung.
 êThis hits the entire party for roughly 1000 points of damage, so again,
 êbe sure to prepare yourself for it. While it's also possible to get the
 êskill later (from Harpies in the world map desert), now is the absolute
 êearliest point in the game to get this quite powerful water-based skill.

Trivia: The Ropeway changes direction in this one-time only cutscene. Its
 êpropellers are placed upwards when leaving/departing, but they're facing
 êthe other way in the longer scene. This is a small goof up.

There are a few things you should know about the Gold Saucer. First of all, the
major currency of the Gold Saucer is GP (Gold Points). While you can use Gil to
access some attractions, several places require GP to buy and/or access things.
For example, in order to use the Save Point just outside the entrance, you must
pay up 5 GP in order to make use of it.

Note: Later on in the game you can buy GP from a mysterious man who will
 êrandomly appear from behind the small house behind the Save Point.
 êHe will *never* show up before you get the airship, however, and even
 êthen he only appears with about a 1 out of 8 chance. We mention this just
 êin case you were wondering why he wouldn't show up right now - it is
 êbecause he can't.

Talk to the lady near the entrance and choose between a one time pass (3000 gil)
and a lifetime pass (30ê gil). Go with the first; You can get the lifetime
pass later on. After Barret's departure, choose a party member to hang out with
and have some fun! (You can also continue with the game, but don't be a party
pooper and follow us instead!)

There's nothing to do at the Event or Round Square at this time, so skip those.
At the Ghost Square you can enter the Ghost Hotel and read Turtle's Paradise
Flyer No. 3 (only three more to go). You can also shop at the item shop, which
has more items than any shop you've seen before.

At the Chocobo Square you can bet on Chocobos in competing races. It's not very
worthwhile to spend a lot of money betting right now, as you can join in the
Chocobo race yourself later - for free.

The most variety can be found at Wonder Square. Upon entering you'll meet Cait
Sith, a small little robotic cat riding a giant furry moogle. He initially comes
equipped with the Manipulate Materia, which is a very useful addition to your
arsenal. He's eager to join the party, so it can't be helped.

Go upstairs and you'll be at the heart of the actual Wonder Square. Many mini
games can be attempted here, and each has its own mechanics or details. For more
information regarding each mini game, check the Gold Saucer section.

If you're looking to make some big GP during your very first visit, there are
little options. Complete Mog's House (feed Mog 5 Kupo Nuts and 3 Kupo Nuts
respectively) and talk to the man who was looking over your shoulder to receive
a one-time only 30 GP. You also receive 10 GP for every time you finish the</span><span id="faqspan-4">
G-bike and score over 10ê points (with a Speed Source thrown in as a one-time
only prize). If you get adept at the Super Dunk mini game, this will be your
major GP income: You can get up to 300 GP per game! This is enough to purchase
a lifetime Gold Ticket for the Gold Saucer. The lady sells this, along with
several other pricey items. Don't ever buy the ??? item - this is a Carob Nut
and there are much easier methods of acquiring one when you need it.

Visit the Speed Square with at least 10 GP in the pocket and give it a shot.
You'll shoot targets whilst riding in a fast rollercoaster - check the Gold
Saucer section for all the details you'd possibly like.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 13:&gt;
~êP
You don't have to do this right away, but make sure you get the Umbrella before
you get the airship (or simpler said, try to get it on Disc 1). You'll need to
score 5000+ points in order to win the Umbrella.
~êP

Set foot in the Battle Square to proceed with the story. The team finds all
employees shot, and a barely alive girl manages to brabble '..man with a gun
arm..', this doesn't sound good! Dio - the owner of the Gold Saucer - finds the
team amongst the dead bodies and assumes they are guilty. Next thing you know it
you're in the Corel Prison, a place where no one gets in or out.

Corel Prison:
-ê
There are random encounters in the Corel Prison; Be wary of Bandits - they steal
items from you like Vice and Prowlers did earlier in the game.

If you want more information, inquire with Mr. Coates in the truck. You can use
the driver seat to rest. The house on the lower right is a bar and item store.
Barret can be found in the house above it. After Barret clears the story up for
the team, form a party with Barret in it. If you're not planning on using Cait
Sith as a member, remove his Silver Armlet and Manipulate Materia and give them
to Barret or Cloud. Make sure to give Barret a long range weapon and place him
in the back row if he isn't already.

The northern area of the prison has an empty tube with an empty chest and a
skeleton of a hound in it. The skeleton resembles an enemy called Test Zero,
which could be encountered in this tube in the first Japanese Version, and was
originally used to test the game's battle system. Similarly, the programmers
also used this area with Pyramid enemies. Lastly, although this isn't actually
visible in-game, one of the programmers left behind a drawing of a red man.
Unfortunately there is absolutely nothing to be done here other than visiting
the place for fun.

When you reach the desert border, head immediately right to get to a junkyard.
This is a good opportunity to encounter Death Claws and learn the enemy skill
Laser. This is essentially a Demi 2 spell against a single enemy, with a cheaper
MP cost (and earlier in the game too). It halves an enemy's HP unless they're
immune to Gravity. If you don't learn this skill now, take note that the next
opportunity to learn it won't be until Disc 3. You can manipulate Death Claws to
make the learning process easier.

Tip: You can learn Matra Magic on the 2nd Enemy Skill from Bullmotors here.

Note: If you enter the desert itself you can still return south when you're in
 êthe first screen. If you proceed through several screens, reaching the
 êCorel Prison by foot becomes extremely hard. Your best bet is to switch
 êbetween screens until you run into a Chocobo Cart who offers you a ride
 êto the Corel Prison.

 êVisiting the desert can have some benefits, however. You can actually
 êencounter two unique enemies in the desert - which is reason enough to at
 êleast give that a try. You'll know when you encounter a Land Worm - a
 êcreature that was obviously inspired by the film 'Tremors'. There's not
 êmuch to these enormous beasts, but you *can* steal a Turbo Ether from it,
 êwhich - although it doesn't sell well - is a fine item by itself.

 êYou can also encounter Cactuars, although the chance for encountering them
 êis very low: 6.25%. If you *do* however encounter one, you should know
 êthat these little cactus enemies are extremely shy and will escape from
 êbattle rather quickly. They are furthermore immune to all elements and
 êstatus effects, and they *furthermore* dodge 7/8th of all physical
 êattacks! So, are you wondering how to beat these little suckers then?

 êWell, your arsenal is far from complete so your options are limited.
 êAttacking with Matra Magic or Choco/Mog *should* solve your problems,
 êsince they're both non-elemental magical attacks which won't be dodged.
 êIf you've escaped 200+ times by now (which we deem highly unlikely), then
 êChocobuckle will also instantly kill the creatures, who only have 200 HP.
 êWhen you beat a Cactuar you'll be rewarded with a whopping of 10ê Gil.

 êTrivia: Cactuars will never use their 1000 Needles attack, although they
 êtechnically have it in their arsenal. Their twin brothers Cactuers (which
 êyou can encounter much later in the game) *do* use that attack.


Make your way through the scrapyard and the team reaches Dyne, an old friend of
Barret. Looks like Dyne has completely lost it as he intends to destroy every
single thing on the planet.

|-êN|
|Strategy: You'll fight with Barret alone, so make sure to keep Barret's HP ê|
|above 350 at all times to be safe. Start the fight by poisoning Dyne and ê|
|pound away with magic and physical attacks. Limit Breaks inflict a solid ê|
|amount of damage, and if you really want to destroy Dyne, a few castings of   |
|Beta can easily arrange this. ê1|
'-êN'

Dyne can't stand living in this world anymore, and he'd rather join his wife
Eleanor in the afterlife. There's nothing Barret can do about this. With the
pendant that Dyne leaves behind, set foot in Mr. Coates truck and you'll be
given the opportunity to participate in the Chocobo Races. If you manage to win
the race, the team will be free to leave the prison.

After the battle and the scenes you'll be riding the elevator to the Chocobo
Races. Esther can explain how the race works and what the controls are, which
could prove helpful if it's your first time ever to participate.

Tip: You can regain your Chocobo's stamina by holding R1+R2 the whole race.

Note: In the jockey room, *make sure you get the RAMUH MATERIA*. This is lying
in the right corner of the room. If you don't get it now, you'll never be able
to get it (which has consequences for Master Materia much later on as well).

When the race starts, press and hold R1+R2, then press and hold square to make
your Chocobo go faster. When you near the finish line, which is around the space
area with stars, hold down circle for a final dash.

If you win the race then that's great - you're free to go! If you lose you'll
be given another opportunity to win the race. In either case, once you've won,
Dio will apologize in a written letter and gives you a buggy that can cross
deserts and shallow rivers.

Quick To-Do List:
=ê
o Enemy Skill: Aqualung
o Enemy Skill: Big Guard
o Battle Square Prizes
o Enemy Skill: White Wind
o [Fort Condor Battle #4]
o Sleeping Man: Bolt Ring
o Enemy Skills for 2nd Materia
o Superb training area

Enemy Skill: Aqualung
=ê
First of all, drive around in the desert on the world map to encounter a Harpy.
This creature can cast the Enemy Skill Aqualung, which is the first (and one of
the few) water based attack(s) you can get. Indeed, only the summon Leviathan
(gotten much later in the game) and the item Dragon Scales (which can also be
gotten only later in the game) are water based attacks available to the party.
Aqualung inflicts a great deal of damage at this point of the game - around 1000
HP to all targeted opponents - so make sure you're fully healed.

Enemy Skill: Big Guard
=ê
Drive south and cross the river. Head for one of the southern beaches and get
into an encounter with Beachplugs.  To learn the skill Big Guard, manipulate one
of the Beachplugs and have them cast it on your party. Big Guard is by far one
of the best Enemy Skills as it casts Barrier, MBarrier and Haste on your entire
party.

Tip: There's no one home at the stand-alone house in the area around here, but
 êremember it for later.

Battle Square Prizes
=ê
Note: You might want to get the other Enemy Skills first before attempting the
 êsometimes tricky Battle Square battles.

If you head back to the Gold Saucer, do so by entering North Corel and go up
with the ropeway. With the Battle Square reopened it is now possible to win
several awesome prizes including the Championship Belt, which is an expensive
yet powerful accessory that increases Strength and Vitality +30. Three of those
would be nice..

Before you fight in any of the battles, talk to the lady at the base of the
stairs outside the Battle Square and she'll tell you that she only likes
fighters that aren't all talk. If you speak with her again after beating all 8
sequential battles during a round in the Battle Square, she'll give you the
Sprint Shoes accessory, which puts a character automatically in Haste.

To win the battles, definitely get the White Wind enemy skill (see below), as
well as Beta, Aqualung and Big Guard. What's amazing about White Wind is that it
also cures status ailments. A healthy supply of Ethers is essential, and you'll
also want to stock up on Smoke Bombs (stolen from Slaloms, see the 'superb
training area' paragraph below) and Right Arms (stolen from Bombs on the
enormous bridge at Mt. Corel. Right Arms deal massive damage to all enemies on
the screen, while Smoke Bombs allow you to escape the fight while still getting
the BP for that fight (thus they are best used in the last round).

It's important to note that only the 7th and 8th rounds really net you good BP
rewards, so try to at least make it to those rounds. Good bonuses at that point
are 'All Materia Broken' (10ê), 'Green Materia Broken' (9425), 'Weapon Broken'
(8246), 'Item Command Sealed' (7201) and 'Purple Materia Broken' (6645).

Enemy Skill: White Wind
=ê
Drive all the way north/northeast, past the Gold Saucer, and across the
river. Drive with the Buggy INTO Costa Del Sol, and head to the cargo boat.
Speak with the sailor near the boat and offer him 100 Gil to sail back to
the eastern continent. This allows you to do several optional things there.

Tip: When you reach Junon you can call a free heli-taxi by speaking with the
 êsailor in the white uniform in the middle of the street. The taxi can take
 êyou to the next part of Junon or out of town. This saves you a few minutes
 êcompared to walking all the way to the World Map.

Back on the World Map, keep your eyes open for a Zemzelett (a big white bird).
When you encounter one, manipulate it and have it cast White Wind on you. This
skill heals the entire party for as much as the caster's current HP. For
example, if Cloud has 900 HP when he casts it, the spell will heal the party for
900 HP. The spell furthermore removes many bad status effects.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 4:&gt;
~êP
Now is a good time to do the 4th battle. The reward is a Megalixir.
~êP

Sleeping Man: Mythril &amp; Bolt Ring
=ê!
There is also a cave behind a river to the west/northwest of the Mythril Mines
which you might've noticed earlier. Now you can reach it by using the buggy to
cross the shallow part of the river. In the cave is a sleeping man who will tell
you either how many times you've fought battles, how many times you have
escaped, or that large materia needs high level materia..

What use is this to us? If the last two digits of the amount of battles you're
fought in total are the same, the man will wake up and give you an item. If the
numbers are odd (11, 33, 55, 77, 99) you will get the Key Item 'Mythril', which
will be useful later. If the last two numbers are even - with the notable
exception of double zero, which leaves 22, 44, 66, 88) you'll get a Bolt Ring,
which is an accessory that nullifies all Bolt attacks.

You can only hold one Mythril at a time, but you can acquire a new piece of
Mythril if you don't have one at the time.  The Bolt Ring is only given once.


Enemy Skills for 2nd Materia
=ê
If you wish to get Flame Thrower, Beta, L4 Suicide and Chocobuckle for the
second Enemy Skill Materia, backtrack through the Mythril Mines. Equip the
person who needs to learn Beta with the Fire Ring and you shouldn't have too
much trouble with learning it. If you want to learn Matra Magic on your 2nd
Enemy Skill you'll have to backtrack to the stony plains around Midgar.

After getting these Enemy Skills you're mostly done with all optional things at
this time. Go back to Junon and drive into town with your Buggy. If you're
looking for a shortcut to quickly get to Costa del Sol, head to the beach and
blow the whistle to call Mr. Dolphin. The game will now give you the option to
automatically board the cargo boat. This option stays available as long as you
still have the buggy, and becomes unavailable when you get the airship.

Tip: If you're looking for a great training area, don't board the cargo boat
 êjust yet and read the next paragraph.

Superb training area
=ê
If you want to do some serious training, pay the Shinra Soldier 10 gil and ride
the elevator up. In upper Junon, make your way to the long gray alley at the end
of the streets in which a group of soldiers are being drilled. You can turn the
alarm on by flipping the switch at the red alarm light on the wall. When you've
done so, tough enemies can be encountered in this alley which normally only
become available much later in the game. A quick overview of these enemies:

 êSlalom: 1600 HP,  30 MP, 700 EXP, 70 AP, 1500 Gil, Steal: Smoke Bomb.
Death Machine: 2500 HP, 150 MP  900 EXP, 80 AP, 1200 Gil, Steal: W Machine Gun.

Tips: The Slalom halves Water, so instead of using Aqualung you might want to
 êresort to castings of Beta. As for the Smoke Bomb you can steal from them,
 êconsider grabbing a few of these as they can help you win the Battle
 êSquare more easily (as they allow you to escape and keep your BP). Lastly,
 êthe W Machine Gun is a Double Materia Growth weapon for Barret which can
 êbe stolen from Death Machines.

You can easily level your Materia here, especially in Double Growth weapons,
plus the Exp and Gil are great as well. Just make sure you fully heal after
every single battle and wipe out groups of Slalom quickly with several castings
of Beta. If you plan on levelling for a while, note that if you master an 'All'
Materia in a Double Growth weapon, you can sell it for 1.4 MILLION Gil, which
takes about 150 battles. Worth it? That's for you to decide. Whenever you're
ready, head back to the western continent.

From the Gold Saucer, drive south over the river and - although this is
completely optional - head for the destroyed town surrounded by forest. As soon
as you enter you'll run into Reno and Rude of the Turks.

|-êN|
|Strategy: Despite the fact you're facing two Turks at once, this fight isn't  |
|all that difficult. A good opening move would be the defensive Big Guard, ê|
|followed by Poison to both Turks. Finish the fight with Summons and hard ê|
|hitting Enemy Skills such as Aqualung or Beta and they'll retreat in no time. |
| êN|
|You may want to defeat Reno and Rude quickly after each other. If either one  |
|of them is defeated while the other still has HP left, the remaining Turk will|
|escape one turn after their retreated/defeated comrade has left the battle.   |
|This causes them to leave no battle spoils. Therefore it's best to defeat both|
|of them at once. ê>|
| êN|
|Trivia: If Tifa's in your party you'll notice that Rude will attack her less  |
|often than he attacks other party members. In fact, he'll only attack Tifa if |
|all other party members are KO'd, and even then there's a 1/3rd chance that he|
|won't attack Tifa during his turn. Rude has a little crush on her, you see..  |
'-êN'

After the fight, follow the path leading up. Proceed to the far end of the
destroyed reactor and Scarlet and Tseng suddenly enter the scene. Check the spot
that Scarlet inspected to reach out for the Titan Summon Materia. Not what you
call junky Materia, right?

Backtrack to the jungle and head down the other path. Enter the town of Gongaga
by going north. If Aeris and/or Tifa are in your party, an extra scene will
occur when you enter the house on the lower right. The other house on the right
is an item shop, while the house on the lower left is an accessory shop which
also sells Materia. You don't have Mystify and Time yet, so you might want to
consider buying them. You can also climb the pole to visit the weapon store,
which doesn't sell much good.

The Inn is located on the upper left of town, and 80 Gil is the price to rest
up. Grab the X-Potion from the chest here, then explore the house on the upper
right in which you can find the White M-Phone (for Cait Sith). When you return
to the jungle, exit the area by taking the left path. Make sure you grab the
yellow Deathblow Materia on your way out.

Deathblow deals a critical blow - and critical attacks deal twice the amount of
damage - but only if the attack hits. The Deathblow command also reduces your
accuracy by 1/3rd, so only use it with weapons that have a high accuracy.

Back on the World Map, drive southwest through the forests and cross the river.
While crossing forests, take your time to learn the Frog Song Enemy Skill from
Touch Me's (frog enemies). This is a pretty decent skill that inflicts Sleep and
Frog on your opponent at the expense of only 5 MP. It may prove useful soon.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 5:&gt;
~êP
Park the buggy far away from the town in the canyon (Cosmo Canyon). If you
don't do this then the buggy will break down and this means you cannot do the
next Fort Condor Battle shortly, which would be a shame.
~êP

Tip:
-ê
If you want to date Barret at a later date, consider putting him into your party
*before* entering Cosmo Canyon.

Drive to the large canyon, and enter Cosmo Canyon, home of Red XIII.

When you arrive in Cosmo Canyon, answer truthfully that you aren't familiar
around this place. Nanaki - the *real* name of Red XIII - gives the green light
and the party is now allowed inside.

Tip:
-ê
If you want to date Barret (and had him in your party when you entered Cosmo
Canyon), there's a trick to infinitely boost his affection value towards Cloud.
Look for Barret in the room behind Tiger Lily's Weapon Shop and choose &quot;Go on&quot;,
followed by &quot;Yeah, whatever...&quot;. You can now exit and re-enter the room to
repeat this procedure. The first reply gives you +3 affection points when
chosen, and the second option doesn't do anything except aborting the
conversation. Since it you can infinitely repeat this procedure, this allows you
to greatly boost Barret's affection value.

Explore the Inn first, which you can enter by the door on the right. Read the
Turtle's Paradise Flyer No. 5 upstairs and look for an Elixir in the bedroom
corner to the lower left. Back outside, ignore the item shop accessible from
the ladder and follow the steps on the left like Nanaki did.

Inside, read the Turtle's Paradise Flyer No. 4 next to the weapon shop and feel
free to upgrade your main party's equipment. Make your way up to the next floor
and look around the Materia shop that sells HP and MP Plus Materia. These can
dramatically increase your HP and MP, so they're definitely worth buying.

Climb the ladder and head inside the observatory where you'll meet Bugenhagen,
Nanaki's 129-year-old grandfather, who uses a green floating machine to get
around places. After the acquaintance, head down and go inside the kitchen to
find Cait Sith. You can talk to him (or any other party member) to form a team.
When you've made your choice, go back to Bugenhagen and listen well to his
teachings.

It appears the Planet is in pain somehow. Return to the campfire outside and
speak to everyone, lastly to Red XIII. Form a party and follow Bugenhagen to
the hall with a large steel door.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 6:&gt;
~êP
Now's the time to do the 5th battle at Fort Condor. You can only travel back to
the eastern continent if you didn't let the buggy break down. Otherwise, this
battle can never be fought. The prize for your long trip is 5 Hi-Potions, even
though the game tells you the prize is five &quot;Potion&quot;. This is a mis-translation.
~êP

Talk to Bugenhagen and climb down the ropes until you reach the cave of the Gi.
The undead roam this cave, many of which cast Death-Sentence, an Enemy Skill
that brings a timer of 60 seconds above the inflicted target, dealing Death as
it runs out. Try and learn it on your Enemy Skill Materia. While on the subject
of Enemy Skills, take note that Frog Song works wonders around here.

Continue right until you get to an area with several smaller caves, which all
house a weird looking rock. Breaking this open results in a battle, with the
exception of the third cave you walk across - it's on your left side as you pass
by. Breaking that rock opens up a secret entrance that leads to the next part of
the cave.

In the next area, head left and carefully *walk* over the golden substance on
the floor. If you run over the golden goo, Cloud will slip and slam into the
wall from which spikes are erected, inflicting actual damage to your HP. Head
down, backtrack to the previous screen and collect the Added Effect Materia from
the upper path.

This Materia works in a similar way the Elemental Materia works, except that you
can now pair status effects into your weapon or armor.

Proceed north and head down the stairs to collect the Black M-phone in a chest
to the south. Lastly, grab the Ether from a chest to the north before heading
inside the next area.

You'll get to an intersection with five tunnels. Things are much simpler than
they seem: The middle tunnel is a dead end, and the two outermost tunnels are
connected. This leaves one tunnel on the left and right, with the one on the
right being optional. It leads to a chest with an X-Potion (which will prove
extremely useful soon), but you'll have to battle a tough creature called
Stinger as you destroy its web.

Fortunately there's an easy solution to Stingers. While their Sting Bomb attack
deals enormous amounts of damage, casting Frog Song on these semi-boss enemies
will render them completely harmless! Otherwise, Poison is a decent alternative.

Follow the last path and explore the lower left of the screen: Walk through the
cave and move Cloud to the right in order to reach a chest with a Fairy Ring
inside. Head to the far north of this area and cross through the wall on your
left to reach another chest with a Turbo Ether.

Prepare yourself for a boss fight. Equip the Fire Ring on someone and place the
Fire-Elemental Materia combination in someone's *armor*. Approach the demon face
and it'll come to life.

Grab the Gravity Materia after battle and exit to the north. Red XIII now learns
the truth behind his father Seto. Enjoy the incredible scenes and continue your
journey afterwards. You'll find that the buggy has been repaired if it broke
down earlier.

Note: Red XIII receives the Seraph Comb after these events. This is a *very*
 êpowerful weapon with 68 Atk, making Red XIII a wise choice as a party
 êmember.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 7:&gt;
~êP
After finishing the Cave of the Gi, return to Fort Condor to do another battle.
Again the reward is 5 Hi-Potions, even though the game says five &quot;Potion&quot;.
~êP

Trivia: After the buggy has been fixed, repeatedly talk to the mechanic who
 êfixed it and you'll get the option of giving him 1000 Gil.  Doing so
 êwill prompt him to tell you the secret location of the Elixir you

&lt;Perfect Game Note 14:&gt;
~êP
Now is essentially your first chance to steal Vagyrisk Claws from Bagrisks.
The Vagyrisk Claw is an elusive item, and Bagrisks themselves are fairly hard
to find on their own as well.

These green, serpent-like creatures are only found on dirt/rocky areas on the
World Map in this area, but are not found in the dirt areas around the actual
canyon, thus excluding all places with an amber glow.

Head west from Cosmo Canyon all the way until you reach a small area of dirt
that does qualify, and look around for Bagrisks. Stealing a Vagyrisk Claw from
a Bagrisk isn't an easy task, however. As a matter of fact, your chances will
never be any higher than 4.23% chance of stealing a Vagyrisk Claw, and this is
with a Character at Lvl 11. You'll usually steal Softs from Bagrisks instead.

Note that Level 77 is the very last level you can steal a Vagyrisk Claw from
Bagrisks. Level 78 and higher will not allow it, and for those planning ahead,
equipping the Steal Glove will nullify your chances no matter what your levels.

Your goal is to steal 99 of them! Obviously, using the W-Item trick as described
will help you achieve this more easily. In that case, stealing one Vagyrisk Claw
is sufficient enough.
~êP

Cross the northern river and enter Nibelheim, Cloud and Tifa's hometown. Huh!?
Wasn't this place burned down five years ago by Sephiroth? Something fishy is
going on.. Let's do some exploring.

Enter the first house on the left. The inn keeper is telling a story that is
rather inconsistent with the one Cloud told the team, so which one is true?
Talk to the man in a black cape in the back and you'll receive a Luck Source.

Head into the house next to the inn and speak with the black-caped figure near
the fireplace to get an Elixir. Back outside, going clockwise, head inside
Cloud's house for a short scene. In Tifa's house, the black-caped figure
in the back will give you a Turbo Ether. The one upstairs nets you a Platinum
Fist. While you're here, play the piano and try to recall the tune from the
flashback.

Here's how it goes: X, Square, Triangle, R1+Triangle, R1+Square, X, Square,
Triangle, R1+X, O, X, Square, X and press start to end.

If you do this several times you'll randomly receive Tifa's secret savings of
1 gil. The very last house has two black caped kids living upstairs, and one of
them gives you a Luck Source.

The Shinra Mansion (Optional) {OPT-5}:
-ê&
Head inside the Shinra Mansion and give someone a Peace Ring to protect them
against Confusion. Dorky Faces use an attack which causes Confusion, and they
aren't wary of using it often. As for the Jersey enemy, try and learn the great
Enemy Skill ?ê from them. They will never use this attack after being attacked
once, so don't do anything during battle until you've learnt the skill.

The ?ê Enemy Skill is another oddball. It does damage based on how much damage
you incurred: Max HP - Current HP = Damage. In other words, if your Max HP is
1000 and you only have 1 HP left, then ?ê will inflict 999 damage. It is
considered a physical attack, and it can be extremely powerful and helpful when
you're about to get your ass handed to you.

There are quite a few things for you to do in the Shinra Mansion. Let's start
with finding the regular treasure. From the main hall, head into the room on the
right and grab the Silver M-phone in the next screen. Back at the main hall,
enter through the northern door and collect the Twin Viper from a chest. Go
upstairs and find an Enemy Launcher in a chest on the left section of the
mansion. The upper room contains a safe, but we'll get to that in a moment.

Continue to explore the right section of the mansion and grab a Magic Source
from the chest before heading to the basement by the secret entrance. Enter the
library in the basement where you'll meet Sephiroth once again. He's quick to
leave the team behind, but also throws the Destruct Materia at you.

You can either depart for Mount Nibel at this time, or you can do several highly
rewarding optional things. So, you want to know how to open up that safe in the
left section of the mansion? There are several hints scattered all over the
place which reveal the numbers of the safe. The small room next to the entrance
hints at this.

Hint 1 leads to the back of the lid, of the chest where you found the Enemy
Launcher in, nearby the safe. It says: (1) 'Right 36'.

Hint 2 leads to the floor near the piano. The piano is found in the area north
from the main hall, in the room to the left. It says: (2) 'Left 10'.

Hint 3 leads upstairs, to the right part. It tells you to take a specific amount
of steps - instead, just look around the entrance of the room with the chest
that held the Magic Source and tap the circle button. You should find the next
clue around there. It reads: (3) 'Right 59'.

Hint 4 is actually not a visible option, but you can select it, and it just says
the number right away: (4) 'Right 97'.

Now you have the combination of the safe:
(1) Right 36, (2) Left 10, (3) Right 59, (4) Right 97.

Now is a good time to save your game and heal up. When you're ready, go to the
safe and unlock it. You only have 20 seconds to do this, so you've got to be
fast. It is important to note that you CANNOT go past ANY of the numbers at any
time or your attempt will fail. It might take you a couple of tries, but when
you get it right the safe opens and it's time for a boss fight.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 15:&gt;
~êP
There's an important point to take note of here.  Since Lost Number drops the
unique and (normally) non-duplicatable 'Cosmo Memory', you'll want to
duplicate it by means of a glitch that allows you to fight bosses twice.  In
order to do this you must skip a random battle by opening the menu the instant
the game wants to give you a random encounter on a field map.  More information
can be found in section {AP-4}, under the repeating boss glitch paragraph.

In short, you'll want to save outside on the world map and enter the mansion
by running as efficiently towards the boss (take the shortest route).  Note when
you run into an encounter, then reload your save game and run down the same
path.  You'll notice that the encounter happens at the same spot (if all you did
was running in the most efficient way possible - no opening menus or anything).
This allows you to skip that battle more easily and then proceed to Lost Number.

|-êN|
|Strategy: This is by FAR the strongest boss you've encountered so far, so ê|
|you're in for a challenge. The most important event of the battle is Lost ê|
|Number's transformation, which occurs when the demonic creature loses half ê|
|of its HP (3500 HP). It will either change into its red magical counterpart   |
|(if the last attack you hit it with was magical), or change into its purple   |
|physical half (when your last attack was physical). ê|
| êN|
|Both forms are tough, but the physical form is considerably tougher and can   |
|easily deal 2500 damage with its blows. It is highly recommended that you use |
|magical attacks until the creature changes into its magical form, and then ê|
|finish it off with physical attacks and Limit Breaks you'll have built up. ê|
| êN|
|Immediately cast Big Guard and try to keep this up during the battle. It helps|
|to inflict several status effects on Lost Number, with which Cross-slash, ê|
|Seal Evil and Choco-Mog can help you. While the creature is frozen it can ê|
|not transform, so you might find that beneficial. As usual, Beta and Aqualung |
|inflict solid amounts of damage, and White Wind allows you to heal your entire|
|party quickly. ê@|
'-êN'

Lost Number drops Cosmo Memory, Red XIII's ultimate Level 4 Limit Break. This
can most likely not be learnt yet as all his other six Limit Breaks need to be
learned first. The Odin Materia also pops out of the safe, together with the Key
to the Basement.

Head down the basement and unlock the previously locked door. Open the coffin
and have a chat with former Turk Vincent, who appears to have been slumbering
inside this chamber for decades. Make sure you ask him who is he is and you'll
get to name him. He will join you when you finally depart.

Tip: Like Barret and Yuffie, Vincent is a long range character. To benefit from
 êthis ability, place Vincent in the back row.

Mount Nibel is a large complex of dangerous passageways through high, eerie
mountains. The first path is rather straightforward and only the Rune Blade can
be picked up from the first small mountain at the intersection. When you've
nearly reached the bridge, climb the mountain on your right and collect the Plus
Barrette. These weapons both grant Double Materia Growth.

Continue over the bridge until you get to a new area with five pipes. They are
all numbered, the rightmost pipe is #1 and the leftmost pipe is #5. Before
sliding down any of the pipes, walk down regularly first and have Cloud lower
one of the ladders. This is crucial if you're planning to backtrack later.

In either case, sliding down pipe #2 allows you to collect the Powersoul, and
sliding down #4 leads to an 'All' Materia. Ignore the big blue scorpion for now
and exit the screen south. Jump off the ledge and enter the cave down below.

If you encounter a Dragon in this area, take your time to steal a Gold Armlet
from it. With 46 Defense and 4 slots (2x2 linked) it is the best armor at this
point in the game. Dragons also use the Flame Thrower Enemy Skill, in case you
hadn't learnt it yet on all of your Enemy Skill Materia.

Make your way to the end of the cave and grab the Elixir from the chest, which
can be reached by backtracking through a cave on the left side of the area. In
the next screen, simply collect the Elemental Materia and continue to the next
cave. Grab the Sniper CR from a chest here; This is an excellent weapon to pair
with the Deathblow Materia as it has a 255% accuracy by default. Continue to
the reactor and walk past it until you reach the boss area once again.

Save your game and prepare for the upcoming boss battle. Equip one of your
characters with the Bolt Ring and protect the other two characters by equipping
the Lightning-Elemental and Ramuh-Elemental Materia combos in their armors
respectively (you should have access to two Elemental Materia at this point).

If you use Vincent, never use his Limit Break as it'll heal the Materia Keeper.
Lastly, and this is fairly important, give your characters your two Enemy Skill
Materia in order to learn the skill Trine.

Back on the World Map, head west around the mountains and continue north until
you reach Rocket Town.

The first two houses are the weapon shop (left) and the inn (right). The Weapon
store also sells accessories and Gold Armlets. The house on the very left of the
town contains nothing in particular, and the house with the old man standing in
front of it is the Item shop. Talk to the old man several times and look at the
rocket together to receive the Yoshiyuki, a sword for Cloud with only 2 slots.
This powers up when party members are KO'd. If one character is KO'd it deals 2x
damage and if two characters are KO'd it deals 3x damage. You'll soon be able to
make good use out of this sword.

The Item shop also sells the Barrier, Exit and Time Materia. We don't recommend
buying the Barrier Materia as you already have the Big Guard Enemy Skill. The
Exit Materia can be useful as it allows you to escape battles more easily.

Go back outside and enter the house to the far right. Check the back to find a
Power Source inside a chest. Explore the remaining house on the upper right of
town and collect the Drill Arm from the chest. Enter the backyard and the team
finds a perfectly working plane there. A woman named Shera spoils the fun and
tells the team to speak with the captain if they intend to borrow it.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 8:&gt;
~êP
Before doing anything else, exit Rocket Town once you've checked out the Tiny
Bronco in the backyard. It's a *long* trip back, but the reward is decent.
You'll receive the 'Super Ball', which is actually the Superball, a weapon with
high attack power and no slots for Yuffie.
~êP

The captain (Cid) is busy in his rocket. After speaking with Cid, head back to
his house and you'll find that Shinra has arrived as well! Shera will call Cloud
back inside as this might be the only chance to steal the Tiny Bronco. Palmer

|He only attacks with his Mako Gun, which inflicts around 450 damage. Start off|

The Tiny Bronco suddenly takes off! After a very short flight it appears the
plane can only be used as a boat in shallow water. Cid joins the party, which
completes your party (that is, if you've gotten Vincent and Yuffie).

With the Tiny Bronco you can reach a lot more places on the World Map than you
could before. The next section goes over the possibilities.

And as the saying goes: &quot;Cid has a TINY Bronco, if you know what I mean...&quot;

Wutai:
-ê
You'll initially be very close to the Wutai continent. If you want to do this
sidequest right away, skip ahead to the Wutai section.  The game prefers that
you do some other things first, though.

Bone Village &amp; Kjata Materia:
-ê
It's possible for you to go to Bone Village with the Tiny Bronco. You'll get
here quite soon actually, but you can get some useful items that you might want
sooner. Bone Village is located on the north continent. If you bring up the
large map you shouldn't have a problem finding it. Sail all the way around
either the western or eastern continent to reach the beach where you can debark.

In Bone Village, talk to the digging man near the entrance. He has some useful
information regarding where you'll want to go. The foreman sitting near the
small building sells things. His best piece of equipment is arguably the Rune
Bangle, which is the best Double Growth armor in the game. While the Diamond
Bangles he sells are better in terms of defense, the choice is up to you.

You can actually enter the sleeping forest already, even though you can't
actually cross it completely. In the screen with the top view, carefully look
for a red orb appearing and vanishing along the sides of the forest. You'll have
to be quick and lucky to grab it: It's the Kjata Summon Materia.

Note: The Kjata Summon is powerful, but it has a big disadvantage from its multi
-elemental properties. It deals Fire, Ice and Lightning damage, so if an enemy
absorbs, nullifies or halves any of these, the spell will inflict much less
damage than it should. Unfortunately the Materia doesn't grant any elements
when paired with the Elemental Materia either, so you can't take early advantage
from any Elemental protection either.

The Weapon Dealer &amp; Great Gospel:
-ê!
Back on the World Map, return to the Gold Saucer area and enter the single house
nearby Gongaga. Travel by the river running through the western continent to
reach it faster. The weapon dealer living here knows a great deal about the
Keystone you're looking for, but he sold it to Dio, the owner of the Gold
Saucer. The weapon dealer is also looking for a material called Mythril. If you
already have this in your possession you can skip the following paragraphs.

Remember the sleeping man in the cave on the eastern continent? If not, we'll
refresh your memory: There is a cave beyond a river near the Mythril Mines on
the eastern continent that can currently only be reached by using the buggy to
cross it. You can't access it with the Tiny Bronco. In this cave a sleeping man
can tell you either how many times you've fought battles, how many times you
have escaped, or that large Materia needs high level Materia..

What use is this to us? If the last two digits of the number you have fought are
the same, the man will wake up and give you an item. If the numbers are odd
(11,33,55,etc) you will get the Key Item 'Mythril', which the weapon dealer
requires. If the last two numbers are even (00,22,44,etc) you'll get a Bolt
Ring, an accessory that nullifies all Lightning attacks.

Get the Mythril and go back to the weapon seller's house. Give it to him and
he'll let you open up either the small box upstairs, or the large box
downstairs. The large box holds a Gold Armlet, the small one contains Great
Gospel, Aeris' final Limit Break. Needless to say you should go for the small
box. Furthermore, now is the very best time to teach Aeris this Limit Break,
which requires here to learn all other Limit Breaks as well. It grants the
peerless status to all party members for a short period of time, and Aeris is
the only character that can ever cast this status.

Note that it is possible to infinitely reclaim a piece of Mythril from the
Sleeping Man, as long as you choose the small box containing Great Gospel. 

Southeastern Isles:
-ê
You can also explore a new continent on the south east. It's an excellent
training area, especially the beaches with Sea Worms from which you can steal
Dragon Scales, a powerful battle item. Speaking of which, it is an excellent
idea to backtrack to the long bridge on Mount Corel and steal several Right Arms
from Bombs here. This will come in handy soon.

Omnislash:
-ê

Now is the first time you can purchase Omnislash, Cloud's final Limit Break,
from the Battle Square at the Gold Saucer. It costs a whopping of 51200 BP at
this time, so make sure you have plenty of GP before entering the arena. It is
important to note that checking the Keystone in Dio's showroom will advance the
story automatically.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 9:&gt;
~êP
This Fort Condor battle is available as soon as you get the Tiny Bronco. The
reward is three Turbo Ethers.

Note: The Wutai Sidequest can be done on Disc 1 &amp; 2. After you parachute into
-ê Midgar on Disc 2, this quest becomes unavailable. The Wutai Pagoda quest
 êcan always be done, even on Disc 3.

Tip: Before you attempt this optional quest, which you are likely going to do
-ê after you've just gotten the Tiny Bronco, make sure you got a decent supply
 êof Hi-Potions, Ethers and Tents. You'll soon enough find out why.

Tip: The game prefers that you head to the Temple of the Ancients first.  We
-ê can deduct this from the fact that many &quot;slotless&quot; weapons - that is
 êweapons without slots that have a high attack rating, a higher hit %, and
 êa critical hit bonus - can only be found there (or bought on disc 2 in
 êJunon, but that is irrelevant in this context).  Furthermore, the Gigas
 êArmlet you win from the final boss in the Temple of the Ancients also
 êraises Strength with 30 points.

Head over to the large stretched continent to the west and debark the Tiny
Bronco at the southern part on the beach. Head for the large bridge and you'll
be interrupted by Yuffie.. After a short scene you'll be forced to fight an
Attack Squad. They're not as easy as they should be.. not in the least place
because.. your Materia is missing! Yuffie stole your materia and there's no
going back.

Note: Yuffie will not necessarily take all of your Materia as she can only hold
 êso much herself - she'll take precious Materia over common ones in the
 êfollowing order (see table):

'
Note: Read the table from top to bottom, left to right. Start at Master Summon,
 êfollowed by Knights of Round. The Contain Materia is followed by HP&lt;-&gt;MP,
 êand the Enemy Away Materia is followed by Luck Plus.

Tip: Now that your Materia is gone you can change your equipment to balance
-ê things somewhat. Give Cloud the Yoshiyuki, which is very powerful when
 êallies get KO'd (2x power for one KO, 3x power for two KO). Give Red XIII
 êthe Seraph Comb. For all other characters, give them the weapon with the
 êhighest attack rating. If you completed the Temple of the Ancients then
 êgive them the non-slots weapon, which are ideal for this part.  These
 êweapons not only have a high attack ranking, they also have a higher hit %
 êand a critical hit bonus.
 ê
 êThe Gigas Armlet boosts Strength +30. If you have any Champion Belts, those
 êalso raise Strength (and Vitality) +30. Lastly, Power Wrists raise Strength
 ê+10.

Cross the two bridges and enter the valley. You'll have to cross one last
bridge after which you can continue straight north until you reach Wutai.

Wutai:
-ê
You'll spot Yuffie right away. Chase her over the two small bridges and read the
sign on the building with the large pot next to it. This is the Turtle Paradise
flyer contest, and you should probably have read most of the flyers by now.
Enter the pub and you'll run into the Turks.. who are on vacation and rather not
spoil their holiday.

Head northwest to enter a different part of town. The house on the right has a
bedroom in which you can sleep for free, and you can spot a secret entrance
on the left of this room which leads to a chest with a Magic Shuriken. The area
on the right side of the house contains another secret entrance that leads to
a chest with a Hairpin.

Talk to the man in the nearby room several times, and it turns out to be
Yuffie's father! Don't bother chasing Yuffie - it's a dead end. Head back to the
first part of town and enter the house next to the Save Point. Here, grab the MP
Absorb Materia from the chest, which is immediately stolen from you by Yuffie!

Where could she be this time? Explore the house near the town entrance and talk
to the people inside. Hmm, something's fishy here. Check the screen on the left
and chase Yuffie outside. Next, inspect the suspiciously wiggly pot at the pub.
Looks like you've finally nailed her!

Follow Yuffie back to her house and check the 6th flyer for the Turtle Paradise
contest. Flip either lever and you'll discover that Yuffie cannot be trusted
under any circumstances. Free your members and head for the area with the pagoda
once more.

Here, check the large bell on the left and ring it to reveal a secret door.
What's going on? As you exit the place, collect the Swift Bolt and Elixir from
the chests. The Don is quick to escape, leaving the team behind to battle an
Attack Squad. Back outside, inquire with Reno to get a clue where to go next.

Travel to the Save Point and put Barret in your party. Go north to explore the
Da-Chao statues. Follow Reno and Rude, head up at the intersection and walk
around the head of the statue to the next screen. Here, talk to Rude and enter
the cave to find the Dragoon Lance, a great weapon for Cid. Remember this cave
for later, and go back outside.

You may want to build up your Limit Breaks, and it is highly recommended to set
Barret's Limit Break at Level 1 and fill it up. Alternatively, if you already
have Aeris' her 3-1 Limit Break Planet Protector, be sure to put her in your
party to make good use of this Limit Break (which inflicts Peerless on all
party members, rendering them invulnerable for a short while).

Tip: If you have Red XIII in your party, consider equipping him with the Hairpin
 êand putting him in the back row (Hairpin is a long range weapon).

When you're all ready, head south to find Corneo. He's not about to give up 
without a fight and summons his beloved pet Rapps.

| ê526 Base Damage] ê$|
|-êN|
|Strategy: Rapps is a tough boss with no real weakness. The main difficulty of |
|this fight lies in the fact that you have no Materia. If you filled up ê|
|Barret's Limit Break beforehand, immediately select Mindblow to deplete Rapps'|
|MP: This prevents it from casting its powerful Aero3 spell. That spell ê|
|usually inflicts around 1700 points of damage, so it's important to move that |
|out of the way. Alternatively, have Aeris use her Planet Protector Limit Break|
|- that is, if you have it - to render your party peerless for a short, but ê|
|potentially crucial amount of time. ê+|
| êN|
|If Cloud has the Yoshiyuki equipped he'll deal solid damage, especially if any|
|other party members are KO'd. Right Arms or S-mines deal great damage, as do  |
|Dragon Scales or other battle items you might have in your inventory. ê	|
| êN|
|Keep your party alive and well with Hi-Potions and X-Potions, and damage Rapps|
|with Limit Breaks. If you don't have Mindblow - which puts you in a rough ê|
|scenario to say the least - play extremely defensively. Immediately revive any|
|fallen allies and heal everyone with Hi-Potions. Rapps can only use Aero3 up  |
|to six times, since this spell costs him 50 MP per casting, and he only has   |
|300 MP in total. With Aero3 out of the way the boss isn't entirely defenseless|
|but at least less dangerous. ê2|
'-êN'

Trivia: Rapps is the buddy of Aps, whom you defeated back in Midgar's sewers.
 êInterestingly enough, Aps was named after Abzu, a primeval deity from
 êBabylonian mythology, who was loved by an other deity called Tiamat.  In
	that fashion it certainly would not be out of place to name Rapps by its
	proper name, Tiamat.

After beating Rapps, the Turks are quick to save the day and deal with Corneo.
Since they agreed on a truce, the team is left alone for now.

Yuffie will finally give you all your Materia back, although your setup will be
completely messed up. She'll also give you the MP Absorb Materia back.

New Enemy Skills:
-ê
Back on the World Map it's a good time to learn several useful Enemy Skills.
Magic Hammer can be learned from Razor Weed, found on the green plains, and you
can learn Death Force from Adamantaimai, the turtles on the beach.

Magic Hammer drains 100 MP from the target, giving it back to the caster at the
expense of only 3 MP, while Death Force grants immunity to sudden death spells
for the remainder of a battle or until the character is KO'd. You can also steal
Adaman Bangles from Adamantaimai, an armor with an extremely high defense rating
of 93, but with only two slots.

Loose ends in Wutai:
-ê
Head back to Wutai and enter the cat house next to Yuffie's. You'll now find
that the stairs are no longer blocked by one of many kittens and that you can
grab the HP Absorb Materia from a chest.

Give the local weapon store a visit too. They're much more willing to sell
weapons now, which might be slightly better than what you're currently using.

Also stop by the Turtle Paradise Pub. If you've read all six Flyers throughout
the world, AND the contest sign outside the pub, talk to the owner behind the
counter and he'll give you your reward: a Power Source, Guard Source, Speed
Source, Magic Source, Mind Source, Luck Source, and a Megalixir. Not bad at all!

Have Yuffie in your party and go to the Wutai Pagoda. Here she must face
several opponents in order to climb the Pagoda and attain the power of the Water
God. In other words, it's time for a series of boss fights. Equip the Choco/Mog-
Elemental Materia combo in Yuffie's weapon for the first fight.

'-êN'

The last boss is Godo, Yuffie's father. He'll start the battle right away, so
read the note below first and come prepared.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 16:&gt;
~êP
You might want to wait with beating Godo until you've got all 4 Enemy Skill
Materia. That way, you can learn the skill Trine on the remaining ones that
don't have it yet. Without Godo, the maximum amount of Enemy Skill Materia you
can complete is three, and the fourth can never obtain Trine from any other
enemy. The reason for this is because you can't learn Enemy Skills from enemies
in the Gold Saucer Battle Square.

There's another important point to take note of here.  Since Godo drops the
unique and (normally) non-duplicatable 'All Creation', you'll want to
duplicate it by means of a glitch that allows you to fight bosses twice.  In
order to do this you must skip a random battle by opening the menu the instant
the game wants to give you a random encounter on a field map.  More information
can be found in section {AP-4}, under the repeating boss glitch paragraph.

In fact, you'll have to get 99 All Creations this way by winning the first
battle and losing the second. Yuffie needs to learn the limit break while you're
collecting All Creations, otherwise you'll end up missing one copy (meaning
you will only have 98 instead of 99). Incidentally (and ironically), this also
means Yuffie can destroy Godo with her ultimate Limit Break that he himself
gives her!

|Strategy: Godo has *one* major weakness, which is Gravity. A few castings of  |

For beating Godo you receive All Creation, Yuffie's final Limit Break, and the
Leviathan Materia. For now, that's all there is to do in Wutai.

When you've done enough optional things for your liking, head for the Gold
Saucer. Remember how to enter the Gold Saucer? Its entrance is located at
North Corel's ropeway and there is no possible way to enter it by the desert.

Head to the Battle Square and go inside Dio's Showroom on the right. Looks like
you've found the Keystone. Just when Cloud is about the slip that little orb
into his pockets, Dio steps in the room and flexes his muscles. He'll let you
have the Keystone if you perform for him in the arena, leaving you with little
other options. It is possible to receive additional prizes for doing well,
however, so do your very best.

Tip: Your best bet for winning all 8 rounds is to place Cloud in the back row,
 êgive him a Counter Attack Materia, your best armor and weapon, his Limit
 êBreak filled up, an Enemy Skill Materia and a stock of healing items and
 êpowerful battle items such as Right Arm (steal from Bombs on the long
 êbridge at North Corel), Dragon Scales (steal from Sea Worms on the south-
 êwestern continent's beach), and Bird Wing (from Tonadu's on the beaches
 ênear Bone Village). Your best armor is likely an Adaman Bangle at this
 êpoint in the game. With this setup it'll still be tricky, but you've at
 êleast maximized your chances.

No matter how abysmal your performance was, Dio gives Cloud the Keystone. If
you managed to win all eight battles, he'll throw in a Protect Vest and a Choco
Feather as added bonus.

With the Keystone in hand, attempt to exit the Gold Saucer. It looks like the
ropeway has a defect and the team has no choice but to stay the night.

During the night, Cloud is visited by either Aeris, Tifa, Yuffie or Barret.
You had the chance of affecting the outcome: The date mechanics have their own
section in case you're interested in them. [Check section {M1.6}]

Tip: The date consists out of a play at Event Square (unless you're with Barret,
 êthen this is skipped altogether) and a scene in the ropeway of the Round
 êSquare. It's extremely fun to mess up during the play, but we recommend
 êsaving beforehand and trying different outcomes.

After the date you'll spot a rather suspicious Cait Sith. Hey.. What's that he's
holding!? Quickly chase Cait through the Battle Square, Speed Square, Wonder
Square and lastly Chocobo Square. There's nothing to be done after this stab in
the back, but at least you now know who the spy was.. Make sure to check the
cabinet in Cloud's room to find an Elixir, then form a party with Cloud, Aeris
and someone else and set foot to the Temple of the Ancients.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 10:&gt;
~êP
Now that you've gotten the Keystone, a new battle is unlocked at Fort Condor.
The prize is once again three Turbo Ethers.

The Temple of the Ancients is located on the continent south of Junon, and
essentially looks like a pyramid surrounded by forest. The team finds an
injured but not deadly-wounded Tseng inside the temple, who hands Cloud the
Keystone. Take note that once you enter the temple there's no way out until the
story progresses.

You'll find yourself in a large labyrinth which looks like a hassle. Fortunately
it's much easier than it looks on first impression.

Walk past the first flight of stairs as they lead nowhere.  Continue and take
the stairs and vines down.  Proceed right, underneath the large stairs and
collect a Trident from the chest.  From here, ignore the stairs on the upper
part of the screen and travel right.

Climb the large vines and try entering the doorway; apparently it's sealed.
You'll want to follow the mysterious character, so walk the stairs and climb
more long vines while grabbing the Mind Source along the way. Enter the doorway
the character also went through. It appears that he's an ancient, has some items
for sale, can heal your injuries and even save the game for you. The chest on
the right contains a Silver Rifle.

Back outside, climb the vines back down and  underneath the doorway to grab a
Turbo Ether. Descend the large stairs and follow the path until you can climb
the small vines down. The chest there holds a Rocket Punch. Follow the path and
climb the vines up. From here, walk underneath the hallway in front of cloud,
continue right - down the stairs - and climb the large vines to reach the Luck
Plus Materia (given to you as 'Lucky Plus'). Head back and follow the path the
other ancient took.

You'll now be in a room with large, U-shaped boulders rolling down the walkway.
It requires precise timing in order to position Cloud in such a matter he can
crouch to safety under the hollow part of the boulders. When you reach the other
end of the walkway the endless wave of boulders will stop.  Backtrack to the
purple fluid and make sure you collect the Morph Materia - this is missable.

The Clock Room:
-ê
In the clock room up ahead, the way to maneuver over to the other chambers is
by moving the hands of the clock; do so manually. If the hand of the seconds
crosses your way you'll fall down, allowing you to collect the Nail Bat from a
chest. It also triggers an enemy encounter, however. When you exit that room
you'll find yourself at the previously sealed door, meaning you have to
backtrack to the clock room again.

There are many treasures scattered between the rooms. The following list sums up
what you can expect to find in each one of them:

I ê= Enemy Encounter (Toxic Frog x2, Jemnezmy)
II   = Dead End
III  = Enemy Encounter (8 Eye x2)
Iê = Princess Guard
V ê= Ribbon
VI   = Puzzle with doorways
VII  = Trumpet Shell
VIII = Megalixir
IX   = Dead End
X ê= Rolling Boulder Room
XI   = Dead End
XII  = Temple Exit

To proceed with the game, enter room VI. Equip someone with the Ribbon accessory
(which grants immunity to nearly every status effect, with a notable exception
of sudden death). Here, a small puzzle awaits you.

There are nine doorways in this screen and they've been numbered 1-9 on the map.
The left number of a door represents the door's number, while the other number
represents which doorway it leads to. For example, going through door five (the
upper right door) will lead you to door six. Furthermore, you can jump down a
level right below doors 1 and 2. Check which door the person took and take that
one to catch him. You can find a Work Glove in the chest on the lower left of
the screen.

After unlocking the door some scenes unfold and a boss fight commences.

|-êN|
|Strategy: The fight with Red Dragon isn't too tough. Start the fight by ê|
|casting Big Guard on your team, while a decent second move would be to poison |
|or paralyse the dragon.  Unleash powerful attacks such as Aqualung, but stay  |
|away from fire-based spells such as Beta and Kjata. ê|
'-êN'

Give Cloud the Dragon Armlet and pick up the Bahamut Materia that the Red
Dragon appears to have transformed into. Go to the right of the inner sanctum
and inspect the miniature temple. Some scenes unfold and the party must leave
the area. The ancient can heal any remaining wounds you incurred during the
battle with Red Dragon.

Before proceeding, take your time to equip your party appropriately. Give one of
your characters the Bahamut Materia, someone else the Throw Materia, and if you
aren't very high levelled it could be wise to build up Limit Breaks. Head back
to the clock room and head straight into room XII as it's the only accessible
room.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 17:&gt;
~êP
Before you go into room XII, give Aeris an weapon and armor that are not unique.
That means no Princess Guard, Umbrella, etcetera. You can equip Materia and an
accessory on her just fine, however. You already know why this is needed.

Note: It is possible to unequip Aeris' weapon and armor after defeating the
 êupcoming boss, but it's safer to do so now, since the time span for
 êunequipping is very small - in fact, it's at some point during the scene
 êwhen Cloud and Aeris are down in the hole. Some players may want to have
 êAeris' ultimate/best equipment on her when fighting Demon's Gate, which
 êis reason enough to mention this is possible to combine with a Perfect
 êGame.
~êP

At the exit, Cloud and company find that the doors are being blocked by a mean
looking creature called Demons Gate.

Tip: It helps considerably to place your characters in the back row, which will
 êhalve the damage you take from Demons Gate.  Give the Long Range Materia
 êto the character that you intend to use physical attacks with, and stick
 êto magic spells, throw, or items with the others.  Alternatively, or
 êperhaps additionally, you could also put your characters into the Sadness
 êstate by feeding them Tranquilizers.  This also greatly reduces the amount
 êof damage incurred.

|-êN|
|Strategy: Demons Gate is arguably the toughest boss you've fought thus far,   |
|and one of the toughest bosses of the game. The creature attacks quickly and  |
|its attacks cause a lot of damage. Therefore, counter this by casting Big ê|
|Guard at the start of the battle to put everyone in haste and to build up your|
|defense. If your barriers run out, don't hesitate to perform another casting  |
|of Big Guard. êA|
| êN|
|Demons Gate has very high defenses, so most of your attacks do little damage. |
|Notable exceptions are the piercing Bahamut summon (which you can cast only   |
|once right now), battle items such as S-mine and Right Arm, or the Throw ê|
|command. By throwing non-unique weapons at Demons Gate you can quickly inflict|
|thousands of points of damage. You'll probably want to safekeep your unique   |
|weapons, no matter how powerful. ê.|
| êN|
|Stay healthy by occasionally casting the White Wind Enemy Skill. Besides ê|
|being a great healing spell, it also cures any characters inflicted by the ê|
|Petrif-Eye attack. ê<|
| êN|
|Should all else fail, Limit Breaks such as Meteorain really mop the floor with|
|Demons Gate. That is, if you already have access to such Limit Breaks.. ê|
'-êN'

Note: During the scene when Cloud and Aeris are at the bottom of the pit, there
 êis a very small time span during which you have one final chance to
 êunequip Aeris' weapon and armor.
</span><span id="faqspan-6">
A series of scenes occur and you'll eventually wake up in Gongaga. Exit the town
and find the Tiny Bronco parked on the beach south of Gongaga.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 11:&gt;

After the Temple of the Ancients it's time to do yet another Fort Condor Battle.
While the game says you don't get anything (and shows a tiny blank text box),
you receive 5 X-Potions for winning this 10th battle.

Head to Bone Village, located on the northern continent. You may have been here
before, but now is the first time you can actually dig for items. This mini game
is covered more in-depth in the subsections of this guide and for now it
suffices to say that you're looking for the Lunar Harp to awaken the slumbering
Sleeping Forest.

Talk to the man sitting in the doorway, as he's the one in charge of the
diggers. The basic principles of digging are easy. Several fixed spots contain
treasure, but you don't know where those spots are located just yet. In order to
find out where those spots are you can place a maximum of 5 diggers by walking
around the area and pressing the square button to place a digger.

Ignite the bombs afterwards and the diggers will face the direction where one
of the treasure spots lies. The point where their line of view crosses is the
spot you'll want to dig at.

Since the Lunar Harp is located on the upper level, slightly right of the smoke
coming from the lower building, you can simply skip the entire process of
placing diggers around the area to find the spot. Dig at that spot and you'll
find the Lunar Harp in the chest near the entrance next morning.

Tip: You can get several other treasure from Bone Village including the Mop,
Buntline, Megalixir. You can also get infinite Elixirs, Turbo Ethers, Ethers
and Potions. On Disc 2, other unique items will become available as well.

Tip: To stock up on Elixirs, just talk to the foreman and skip placing diggers
and igniting bombs so you can mark the spot. Now, do you see the aircraft? Its
nose lies on the ground. Position Cloud so his head touches the top of the
aircraft's nose. This is the place to dig for Elixirs. Mark it and check the
chest afterwards. You have about a 1 out of 7 times chance to find an Elixir in
the chest, but you can repeat it as often as you'd like.

The Sleeping Forest:
-ê
After collecting the Lunar Harp, enter the Sleeping Forest. The harp is
automatically used to awaken the forest and you can now travel further. If you
haven't gotten the red Kjata summon Materia yet, do so now. The red orb will
appear and disappear on the sides of the screen with the top view, so quickly
run over to catch it.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 12:&gt;
~êP
Right after you awaken the Sleeping Forest with the Lunar Harp, this battle
becomes available. While the game tells misinforms you once more with a blank
text screen, you receive 5 X-Potions for winning this battle.
~êP

Continue north and head under the tree trunk to collect a Water Ring from the
chest. Proceed through the trunk to reach the other side and exit to the
world map.

Note: You can encounter Boundfats in the area with the tree trunk, creatures
from which you can win, steal, or morph into Dazers. This is an item that
inflicts the Paralyse status and it's one of a kind, so you might want to
collect some.

The Forgotten Capital:
-ê
At the world map, enter the Forgotten Capital, also known as the City of the
Ancients. Take a left at the intersection and search the house for a chest with
a Magic Source and a Save Point. Explore the rest of the area until you reach
a large circular chamber.  Go downstairs to find a chest with an Aurora Armlet.
This is a particularly fine armor at this point of the game and absorbs Ice
Elemental attacks.

Go back to the entrance and explore the eastern sections of the city. The first
house contains a Guard Source, while the second holds an Elixir in a chest and
a well hidden Enemy Skill Materia behind the upper bed. Get some rest to proceed
with the story.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 13:&gt;
~êP
This battle is available right after the nap. It's still possible to exit the
city, but it's a long way to backtrack. The game gives yet another blank screen,
but you receive 5 X-Potions once again for your victory.
~êP

From the intersection, go north and enter the building. Collect the Comet
Materia at the very top, then head down the shiny blue stairs in the middle of
the room. Descend the large crystal stairs and use the opportunity to save your
game. It's recommended to equip someone with the Water Ring accessory for an
upcoming boss battle.

Proceed over the stone steps, walk to Aeris and witness a historical scene of
gaming history. A boss battle immediately initiates after the scenes.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 14:&gt;
~êP
This battle is best done right now, since the further you travel and continue
with the story, the harder it gets to return to Fort Condor. The reward for this
battle are three Elixirs.
~êP

&lt;Perfect Game Note 18:&gt;
~êP
Before you continue it is important to collect the following items, which will
all be gone once you proceed with the story up to where you get the airship:

o Umbrella (Speed Square Gold Saucer): You can only can get one of these, which
  is won when you score 5000+ points.  See the Speed Square section for tips.
o 99 Mythril Clips (bought in Junon)
o 99 Four Slots (bought in Costa Del Sol-bar)
o 99 Shotguns (bought in Rocket Town)

This'll cost you 514800 Gil in total, quite a hefty sum of money. Travel to the
beaches of Mideel, the southeast continent and start mastering your 'All'
Materia's - place them in double growth equipment. One 'All' Materia sells for
1.4 million Gil, leaving you with plenty enough money to live a financially
healthy life.

Another noteworthy mention is that the Buggy and Tiny Bronco will vanish from
the map after you get the Airship. The reason for this is that the game can only
store two vehicles on the world map, and the Buggy and Tiny Bronco become nearly
obsolete after acquiring the Airship (and still later on, the Submarine).

There is, however, one area that only the Buggy can travel to: The Corel Prison
(Desert Area). There are two unique enemies here, the Land Worm and the Cactuar.
While neither creature is particularly thrilling, this is your last chance to
fight either of them.
~êP

Coral Valley:
-ê
In the Coral Valley, walk around the shell by going left, around it and collect
the Viper Halberd from a chest. Continue up the steps and Cloud automatically
hops from one to another. Make your way to the top of the shell and enter the
cave on the left.

There are a few more treasures in this area. First of all, climb up the second
crack. Climb up further to collect the Bolt Armlet from a chest. Head down, go
right, climb down the other crack and grab the HypnoCrown from another chest.
This unique accessory increases your chances of manipulating an enemy given it's
possible to manipulate the enemy in the first place.

Climb up to grab the Megalixir in the chest on the upper right. Head left from
here to ascend yet another crack. Climb down the ladder on the left to reach the
Magic Plus Materia. Climb the ladder and exit the screen on the right to reach
the end of the caves. Collect the Power Source from the last chest and exit to
the world map.

On the snowy world map, travel west and curve north around the mountains to 
reach the isolated Icicle Inn.

Icicle Inn:
-ê
The house on the nearby left is the local weapon shop and sells very decent
weapons. The house on the very right with the snowman contains the Key Item
'Glacier Map', a Hero Drink and a Vaccine.

Head for the Inn - also located on the right side of town - and go upstairs.
An X-Potion is lying in the left corner, barely visible through the window-pane.
The house on the upper left of town holds some interesting background story on
Professor Gast and Ifalna, Aeris' mother. Check the apparatus to watch the
videos, co-starring Hojo. Look for a Turbo Ether downstairs.

Back outside, talk to the man on the north side of town and Elena of the Turks
shows up. Dodge her GRAND PUNCH and head to the house in the middle of town.
Have a word with the kid and he'll lend you his Snowboard. The fact you'll never
bring it back to him doesn't matter.

Now that you're all set, head north and talk to the man again. He's got the
know-how of snowboarding, so have a listen if you're a first timer. During the
snowboarding course you'll come across two intersections. Depending on which
ones you take you'll end up at a specific area in the Great Glacier. See below
for the exact locations.

The Great Glacier isn't too hard to navigate with a map in your hands. First
there are a few things you need to know about the Great Glacier.

Passing Out:
-ê
- You can't run around the Great Glacier forever. The cold temperature only
allows the team to run for a certain period of time, and after '544 steps',
Cloud will pass out and wake up at Mr. Holzoff's Cabin at the base of Gaea's
Cliff. The counter is incremented by 1 unit every time you take a step, although
a step is hard to measure.

- 544 steps equals approximately 145 seconds of movement in the NTSC American
version of the game. For the PAL version it equals approximately 174 seconds.

- When you enter the Great Glacier from the world map or from the snowboarding
minigame it is reset to 0. The counter is also reset if you enter any field in
the Great Glacier with a value higher than 544 (and thus allowing you to pass
out again after being rescued by Mr. Holzoff).

-êP
- Glitch: You cannot pass out in the 'Base of Gaea's Cliff' field just outside
Mr. Holzoff's house. This allows you to increase the counter past 32767, causing
it to overflow. When this happens, the counter goes into a negative figure and
the game no longer recognizes the counter as being higher than 544. This results
in an immunity to passing out in the Great Glacier.

- It takes very long to make the counter overflow and there's no real way to
tell whether you've overflowed it already other than by extensive field testing.
However, if you're set on completing this tedious task, remember you can always
save your game at Mr. Holzoff's house. You can't set foot in the Great Glacier
until you think you've reached overflow.

- For the NTSC version of the game you'll have to run around for approximately
145.5 minutes (not seconds!), while you'll need to run around for about 174.6
minutes in the PAL version. It doesn't hurt to add 10 minutes to these amounts
so that you know for certain you've overflowed the timer.
-êP

&lt;Perfect Game Note 19:&gt;
~êP
If you're attempting a perfect game you'll need to take note of the following.

2 copies of Un-mastered Alexander Materia (keep the 'source' available):
-êH
It's possible to duplicate the unique Alexander Materia by performing a very
specific series of steps, causing Cloud to collapse the very moment you pick
up the materia. This allows you to keep the Alexander Materia in the field so
you can pick it up again. It works because the game first hands you an item, but
only removes it from the field after you confirm the text box telling you that
youve received it. Collapsing at the same time never closes that text box, thus
never removing the item/materia from the field, allowing the duplication trick.

  The trick to duplicating this materia goes as follows (it is vital you do
  exactly what the instructions tell you to - the path Cloud walks is of
  importance indeed. You must only input the directional buttons mentioned;
  if the instructions tell you to run right, you must only hold X and the right
  directional button, for example. The same applies to all instructions. And
  yes, it matters whether or not Cloud runs or walks):

  Preliminaries: 1. Find Snow's Cave and defeat her, but do NOT pick up the 
 êAlexander Materia she drops.
 ê2. It helps to equip several (mastered) Enemy Away Materia to
 êreduce/prevent enemies from attacking you while performing
 êthe below trick.

 êField Instructions:
 ê-ê
  1. Walk around in the Great Glacier long enough to make Cloud pass out.
  2. Directly exit the cabin via the shortest route and immediately go back
 êinside (all by running).
  3. Run RIGHT (indeed only the *right* directional button) and save at the Save
 êPoint. Reset the game afterward and load up your savegame.
  4. Back in the cabin after loading, run LEFT. (Yes, Cloud will in fact run up
 êon the screen until he stops; this is normal.) When Cloud stops, run DOWN.
 êCloud will exit the cabin.
  5. Outside, run while holding both R1 + DOWN.
  6. In the large snowfield (where the wind changes the direction of the screen)
 êit doesn't matter how you run exactly, as long as you exit via the far
 ê(initial) right side of the screen so you end up at the right side of the
 êGreat Glacier for our purpose.
  7. When you reach the first snowy path, *WALK* (not run) RIGHT. On the second
 êicy path, again *WALK* RIGHT. Again, on the third rocky path, *WALK* RIGHT.
  8. In the next field, *WALK* RIGHT (yes, just the directional right button) 
 êuntil Cloud stops. At this point, *WALK* by using L1 + RIGHT simultaneously
 êto enter the cave.
  9. Inside, *WALK* DOWN until Cloud stops. At this point, *WALK* by pressing
 êL1 + DOWN until Cloud stops again (indeed, at the cave's right corner.)
 êFrom here, simply *WALK* UP all the way until Cloud stops again.
 10. At this point you'll have to *WALK* DOWN until Cloud stops, then *WALK* UP
 êuntil Cloud stops, and repeat this for a total of ten times. Cloud should
 ênow be standing against the wall, not facing the screen.
 11. Now for the final step: *WALK* DOWN and when Cloud stops, keep holding the
 êDOWN button pressed. Then, while holding that down, add at the exact same
 êtime L1 + CIRCLE. This simultaneously moves Cloud AND picks up the
 êAlexander Materia. You now have a copy of it while the source remains
 êintact. (Do NOT press circle a second time; you MUST keep the text box
 êavailable that says you've received the Materia.)

 [Why do I have to keep the 'source' available - that is, keep the Alexander 
  Materia in the field? The answer is fairly simple. You'll want to collect at
  least two copies of un-mastered Alexander materia to show that you have the
  knowledge (and skill) to pull this trick off, and to show that in theory you
  could repeat it to fill your inventory with as many copies as you'd like.
  Since there are multiple uniquely duplicatable materia, there is no fixed
  amount of materia you should dupe. However, someone could always argue that
  you do indeed need to have a certain specific amount of unmastered copies.
  Because of this, it's wise to simply dupe the materia twice and leaving the
  source, that is the Alexander Materia in the field, right where it is. That
  way, you can always decide later to dupe more since the source is readily
  available to you.]

2 copies of Un-mastered Added Cut Materia (keep the 'source' available):
-êH
  Preliminaries: 1. It helps to equip several (mastered) Enemy Away Materia to
 êreduce/prevent enemies from attacking you while performing
 êthe below trick.

 êField Instructions:
 ê-ê
  1. Walk around in the Great Glacier long enough to make Cloud pass out.
  2. Directly exit the cabin via the shortest route and immediately go back
 êinside (all by running). 
  3. Run RIGHT (indeed only the *right* directional button) and save at the Save
 êPoint. Reset the game afterward and load up your savegame.
  4. Back in the cabin, run UP so Cloud enters the other room.
  5. In this room, run out by holding L1 + LEFT.
  6. In the cabin's first room, run outside by holding L1 + LEFT again.
  7. Outside the cabin, exit the screen by *WALKING*, by holding L1 + LEFT.
  8. In the large snowfield (where the wind changes the direction of the screen)
 êit doesn't matter how you run exactly, as long as you exit via the far
 ê(initial) right side of the screen so you end up at the right side of the
 êGreat Glacier for our purpose.
  9. When you reach the first snowy path, *WALK* RIGHT. On the second icy path,
 êagain *WALK* RIGHT. Again, on the third rocky path, *WALK* RIGHT.
 10. In the next screen (which is outside Snow's Cave) *WALK* by holding R1 +
 êRIGHT until Cloud exits the screen.
 11. At the next two southwest/northeast slopes, *WALK* by holding R1 + DOWN.
 12. At the four-way intersection, *WALK* UP.
 13. You're now at the southeast/northwest slope. *WALK* LEFT.
 14. You've now reached the slope with Added Cut. Run by holding L1 + UP. When
 êCloud stops, run by holding L1 + DOWN to exit the screen.
 15. At the previous slope, run by holding L1 + UP to enter the Added Cut slope
 êagain.
 16. At the Added Cut slope, run by holding L1 + UP.
 17. Now that you're near the Added Cut Materia, simultaneously press LEFT +
 êCIRCLE to pick it up while keeping the source available. (Do NOT press 
 êcircle a second time; you MUST keep the text box available that says you've
 êreceived the Materia.)
~êP

Great Glacier Points of Interest:
-ê!
The map has several areas of interested marked by a number. When you move
between areas of interest you'll find that you're walking up, down, right and
left, which doesn't always make sense. Just see these paths as connecting roads
between the areas of interest.

What follows next is a brief description of each area of interest.

(1) Entrance of the Great Glacier. There's a sign that reads 'Ice Gate' here.

(2) There's a single tree and a bridge here.

(3) There are many pine trees in this screen, and you can find a Mind Source
somewhere in the upper middle area.

(4) Part of a frozen lake on which you can find a single Potion. The bottom half
of the screen shows several pine trees and solid ground.

(4+) If you head northwest from screen (4) you'll get to a little puzzle. The
solution can be found below. In the cave on the other side you can find a
Safety Bit.

Note: The number 1 means you need to jump in that direction first, followed
later by number 2.

(5) This icy canyon holds many exits to other areas, including a cave that
leads back to the world map. The cave areas are marked by (5+) and (5++).

(6) This icy area is viewed from an eagles-eye perspective and contains a cave
in the middle. Inside this cave you can find an Elixir.

Tip: You can get infinite Elixirs upon reaching this cave. When you press circle
ONCE to pick up the Elixir, the game says 'Received Elixir!'. Do NOT press
circle again and simply walk out of the cave - the game actually allows you to
do this. When you enter the cave again, the Elixir can be grabbed over and over
again, allowing for an early infinite stock of Elixirs!

(7) A tree trunk serves as a bridge here.

(8) This is where the hot springs are located. Move near the water and touch
the hot springs in order to do a side quest soon.

(9) This screen only contains a lone pine tree.

(10) This intersection leads to four different areas in total, but the upper
right path has a special property: It will take you back and forth to screen 8,
*but* if you go south from screen 13 you'll end up at this intersection as well.
It's not possible to travel to screen 13 from here, but we'll get to that soon.

Furthermore, the path on the upper left leads to area 8 as well, while the lower
left path leads to area 9. In order to find the Added Cut Materia, travel the
upper right path to area 8 and check the second pathway thoroughly. You'll find
the Materia in an alcove on your right-hand wall.

(11) This mountain trail contains a cleverly hidden Moai Face in the upper left
mountain. The left trail leads back to area 6, while northern trail leads to the
Snowfield (Area 12).

(12) This is the Snowfield. The wind changes direction occasionally, so you
have to place landmarks while walking to maintain a steady direction. In the
middle of the field is a cave which contains an 'All' Materia inside. If you
travel to the east of the Snowfield you'll reach the elusive area 13.

(13) This area can only be accessed from the Snowfield by heading east from
there. The cave here is inhabited by a witch named Snow. Initially not very
unfriendly, but talk to her after touching the hot springs and she'll get mad,
initiating a boss fight. She's just as weak as any other Snow enemy, but you
receive the Alexander Summon Materia for your victory.

Tip: It's not a bad idea to steal the Circlet accessory from Snow (or any other
Snow enemy for that matter). This accessory increases your Magic and Spirit by
+30 each!

After fully exploring the Great Glacier, make your way north of the Snowfield
to reach the base of Gaea's Cliff and Mr. Holzoff's house. You'll be brought to
Mr. Holzoff's house automatically whenever you pass out.

After resting and saving at Mr. Holzoff's house, prepare yourself to ascend the
cliff. You'll need to keep Cloud's body temperature between 26 and 38 degrees.
If it falls below 26 degrees, Cloud will pass out and is brought back to Mr.
Holzoff's house again.

Climb the cliff and follow the linear path of cracks until you reach a large
cave.

Note: The Gaea's Cliff is a one-time-only area. You cannot return after certain
 êevents have taken place. It is wise to learn the Trine enemy skill from
 êcreatures called Stilva (which looks like a red, smaller version of the
 êMateria Keeper). Also take your time to learn the Magic Breath Enemy Skill
 êfrom Stilva. Protect yourself against this attack by equipping gear that
 êkeeps you safe from Fire, Ice or Lightning attacks.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 20:&gt;
~êP
You need to morph Stilva or Evilhead into an Holy Torch. Depending on whether
you're planning to use the W-Item trick later on, you might need to get 99.
It is also possible to morph a Stilva in the Battle Square later on, but that
will require much more time in case you're planning to collect 99 legitimately.
~êP

In the icy cave, head north to the next area. Go left here, then south to reach
the upper walkway of the previous area. Head over the ice bridge and keep
running to the right - you'll walk straight through a secret entrance in the
wall to your right. This leads to a very secretly placed chest with a second
Ribbon accessory.

Go north and grab the Javelin from the chest on the right, then proceed through
the doorway on the left. In the next screen, walk through the tunnel to reach a
boulder. Kick it and it'll remove an obstacle below. Backtrack to the unlocked
area and head through the previously blocked tunnel. Follow the linear path to
exit and climb another cliff.

This time there are several dead ends you'll want to avoid climbing. Go straight
up at the first intersection, the second time go right. The remainder of this
cliff is straightforward.

Tip: You can encounter Malboros at any outside are of Gaea's Cliff. These
creatures usually attack with their Frozen Beam, but they also sporadically use
their Bad Breath Enemy Skill, which casts several bad status effects on all
targets. It's a handy skill that you might want to pick up, but be sure to give
Ribbons to two of your members for protection against the bad statuses.

The next cave contains a save point. The doorway to the north can't be reached
yet, so take a right, follow the outside path and you'll reach a ledge with
several icicles hanging from the ceiling. Every time you pass one it'll initiate
a fight. Win it - a single casting of Beta does wonders - and the icicle drops
down. Grab the Fire Armlet from the chest on the right first and collect the
'Last Elixir' from the chest on the very left after defeating all icicles. Exit
and re-enter the screen to get the option for jumping down, which is a little
faster than backtracking.

Return to the large hall with the save point and you'll notice that the fallen
icicles have bridged the gap between the exit and the hall. Collect the Elixir
from a chest in the lower right corner of the room, and a Speed Source from the
now accessible chest in the upper left corner.

The mountain trail contains a chest with the Enhance Sword. At the end of the
path you've reached another climbable cliff. Whenever given the option at an
intersection, choose to climb up and you'll reach the next cave quickly enough.

This area contains a Save Point and a pool that heals the party upon touching
it, making this an excellent place to level up. A noteworthy encounter here are
Blue Dragons, fierce creatures which drop a Dragon Armlet. Before proceeding
down the next hall, equip one person with the Aurora Armlet and Fire Ring, an
other member with a Fire Armlet, and the remaining character with a Dragon
Armlet and either an Ice Ring or Fire Ring. Protection against Earth and
Lightning doesn't hurt either; an Elemental - Lightning/Earth combination in
someone's armor may be beneficial in the upcoming boss battle.

At the end of the next hall, the party encounters a two headed hydra-like,
dual-polar dragon called Schizo. Yipes!

|Strategy: Before doing anything else, make sure you steal the rare Protect ê|
|Ring from Schizo (Right), which is a great accessory. Immediately follow up   |
|with a casting of Big Guard afterwards. ê'|
| êN|
|If you've come prepared with protection against Fire, Ice and perhaps Earth   |

|Aqualung and Comet, although you'll want to refrain from casting Beta; one of |
|the heads absorbs fire. ê7|

|When one of the heads dies it'll perform a Final Attack Breath which inflicts |

|An alternative strategy is to drain both heads from their MP completely. This |

&lt;Perfect Game Note 21:&gt;
~êP
In order to obtain 99 Gigas Armlets you'll need to steal them from the purple
giants called Gigas, which can be encountered during your descent.

You furthermore need to win an Earth Mallet from Gigas (and even an insane 99
when you don't want to do the W-Item trick). Remember that you can't win an item
if you've already successfully stolen from an enemy.

If you're doing a no escape game as well, you'll have to cope with Grenades on
here as well. The Protect Ring gives you some protection against their powerful
self destruct, while placing everyone in the back row and having them defend
also helps a great deal.

Note: If you're also following the Max Natural HP/MP challenge, things might get
rough around here and you may want to resort to the 'Extended W-Item' trick,
with which you can duplicate any armor (and weapons) that can be stolen from
you. Alternatively you can keep two characters dead to refrain them from getting
experience.
~êP

In case you're just looking for a decent armor, remember that Gigas Armlet
increases your Strength by +30 points! The downside of the armor is that it has
zero Materia growth.

Tifa joins in the next screen if she isn't already in your party. Simply
continue, collect the Neo Bahamut Materia in the next screen and head past the
Save Point to initiate a scene.

The next area has a dangerous whirlwind sweeping through the path, occasionally
blocking the way. The cloaked clones can be inspected to receive a Hi-Potion
and Ether. To cross the whirlwind, quickly make a run for it when the wind is
still for a moment. If Cloud gets swept back you'll have to fight a Wind Wing
enemy.

Note: The enemies around this area are mostly unique and never fought elsewhere.
You might want to take your time and fight each of them. Dragon Riders and
Killbins can be morphed into Mind Sources.

Collect a Kaiser Knuckle from the chest as you continue down the trail. The next
whirlwind has an additional green wave running through the regular barrier that
must also be avoided. Before proceeding to the last area, equip your party with
gear that protects against Fire. After a short scene, a boss battle starts.

'-êN'

After the battle, choose either Red XIII or Barret for safekeeping the Black
Materia and speak with Tifa to continue. Don't forget to collect the MP Turbo
Materia and grab the Poison Ring from the chest when you exit north.

The last whirlwind has yet another obstacle as you have to avoid the timed
lightning bolts zapping down the path at a fixed rate. When you reach the
whirlwind's epicenter, a large amount of scenes take place as the team finally
encounters the real Sephiroth.

After the long series of scenes you awaken as Tifa, somewhere in a prison cell
in Junon. Talk to Barret, then follow the escort - there's nothing else you can
do except use the Save Point you come across. After some scenes in the press
room, fight off the Attack Squad and check the gas chamber's door to initiate
another scene.

Team up with Cait Sith and exit the press room. Turn right, go outside and talk
to the reporter, who appears to be no one other than Yuffie. Make your way to
the elevator - try walking during the animation as you can't get into random
encounters at that time - and head for the Highwind.

Back at the gas chamber, Tifa is struggling for her life. There's no need to
worry about doing the following instructions within a time limit: Tifa can hold
her breath indefinitely. First you need to collect the key which the Shinra
Guard dropped, then you need to untie yourself with it. Either combination as
listed below works:

1) X, X, Triangle, X + Triangle, Triangle + Circle,   Circle.
2) X, X, Triangle, X + Triangle, Square   + Triangle, Square.

When you're out, press the button near the orange led in the corner to stop the
gas. While the door is locked shut, Sapphire Weapon is about to lend you a hand.
Simply make your escape off the canon - there is no way the soldiers can ever
catch up to you - and bitch slap Scarlet.  I could be mean and tell you that,
in order for a &quot;perfect game&quot;, you're not allowed to ever let Scarlet hit Tifa,
but I'll save you from that horror.  In any case, the airship shows up just in
time for Tifa to make her escape.

Head in the cockpit and speak to Red XIII, Barret, Cid and the trainee pilot
respectively. After that, go to the Operation Room and speak with the crew
member to form a party, heal, or save your game. Now you're free to speak with
the pilot and take off!

With the Highwind in your possession you've suddenly gained access to a whole
lot of new terrain on the world map. The Highwind can only land on grass areas
however, and won't land on rocky terrain, desert, or forest.

&lt;Fort Condor Note 15:&gt;
~êP
The last optional battle of Fort Condor can now be fought. The man will tell
you that you've missed five battles, but that's due to sleepyhead Tifa who was
in coma for seven days. There is no way to actually ever do those five battles.
The prize for this last optional battle is again 3 Elixirs.
~êP

Optional Exploration:
-ê
While not required, you can collect several new treasures all over the world,
most of which are very worthwhile.

Revisiting Old Places:
-ê
o Many shops have new supplies of wares, such as the shops of Fort Condor,
  Junon, Rocket Town and Costa Del Sol (man in the bar). If you've gotten 30ê
  gil from mastering an 'All' Materia you can also easily buy the villa and
  turn it into 'Villa Cloud'. The only benefit is that you can now rest here
  for free, but it's rather neat to have a villa next to the beach!

o If you visit Nibelheim and play Tifa's Piano (while you're in charge of Tifa)
  you'll receive an Elemental Materia. You only get this if you chose that you
  'jammed on it' in the Kalm Flashback.

o The Item Shop in Cosmo Canyon - located on the far right of the campfire -
  contains a few items you can collect now, as the backroom is now accessible.
  You can find the Fullcure Materia here, along with an Elixir and Magic Source.

o Rocket Town also has some new treasures. Collect the Fourth Bracelet from a
  chest in the weapon store, then go inside the Item Shop (with the old man
  outside) and look for a Guard Source in the backroom.

Chocobo Sage &amp; 4th Enemy Skill Materia:</span><span id="faqspan-7">
-ê'
o Fly over to the northern continent and check the isolated house just northwest
  of the Corral Valley Cave. Inside you'll find a demented old man who was once
  known as the Chocobo Sage. Talk to his green(!) Chocobo and it'll spit out
  the fourth and final Enemy Skill Materia. The Chocobo Sage also sells a few
  rare nuts and greens.

  Tip: In order for the Chocobo Sage to remember more things regarding Chocobo
  Breeding, simply fight between 3 to 6 battles and he'll remember more.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 22:&gt;
~êP
With the fourth Enemy Skill Materia in hand, you can now complete the Wutai
Pagoda with Yuffie if you hadn't done so already. Before fighting Godo, equip
Yuffie with *ALL* Enemy Skill Materia that haven't learnt Trine yet, and *DO
NOT* equip her with any Enemy Skill Materia that already know the skill. Save
beforehand and double check after the fight if everything went well.

Note: You can only defeat Godo after you've obtained 99 All Creations (with
 êYuffie also having learnt this Limit Break) via the repeating boss fight
 êtrick.
~êP

Cactus Island &amp; Tetra Elemental:
-ê 
o Fly straight south from Cosmo Canyon and search for a small island, mostly
  covered by desert. This is Cactus Island. In the desert area you can encounter
  Cactuers, little cacti enemies that morph into Tetra Elementals. This is a
  good accessory that absorbs Fire, Ice, Earth and Lightning.

  Cactuers pack a punch with their 100 Needles attack that always does 1000
  damage, while their normal 'Mystery Kick' does around 750 damage. They are
  also very hard to hit and you only have a 1/8th chance you can hit them
  normally with physical attacks. Fortunately, there are a few ways to morph
  them easily. The Cactuers are level 40, so if you cast the Enemy Skill L4
  Suicide on them they'll instantly be down to critically low HP. You've got two
  options at this point. You can either manipulate them, making them an easy
  target for morphing, or you can paralyse them using the item Dazers (gotten
  from Boundfat enemies in the Corral Valley, just north of the Sleeping
  Forest). If you get three Tetra Elementals you always have enough for your
  entire active party.

Goblin Island:
-ê
o Fly to the other side of the world map, to the islands northeast of the 
  eastern continent. The forests are inhabited by Goblins from which you can
  learn the Goblin Punch Enemy Skill, a physical attack with no MP cost. It does
  a lot of damage if your opponent's level is equal to your own. Take your time
  to steal a Zeio Nut or two from them too, which will come in handy during
  Chocobo Breeding.

Early Quadra Magic Materia:
-ê
o Fly the Highwind to the east of the Chocobo Ranch and look for a cave. This
  stretched continent lies adjacent to a cliff with grass area. It is actually
  possible to land the Highwind on the cliff and debark on the dirt area,
  allowing access to the cave that contains the Quadra Magic Materia.

  To do so, fly and land the Highwind near the cliff in such a matter that when
  land you are facing south. Steer the Highwind with Square and the D-Pad to
  make the landing easier. During the landing, hold the up/left buttons along
  with L1 - if all goes well you'll now be standing on the dirt area.

Here's a video that shows how it's done (on Youtube). All credits go out to the
original poster of the video. Go here: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vhDDj_b1hek

Second Chocobo Lure Materia:
-ê
o Collect a free Chocobo Lure Materia by walking to the right of the fence at
  the entrance. You'll also want to buy one Mimett Greens.

Mideel is found on the continent south of Fort Condor. It's a quiet little town
but it does hold a few secrets. Check out the shops and speak with the crazy
costumer: Apparently she's stocking up on supplies before Meteor hits. Of more
interest is her white baby chocobo. Give it your Mimett Greens it so eagerly
desires and tickle the birdie behind its ears to receive the Contain Materia.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 23:&gt;
~êP
Make sure to talk to the crazy woman in every shop. This is crucial for later
when she'll have the items the shops used to sell. You definitely want to be
able to buy from her, or you may not be able to get 99 of some items. Having her
shop available is required for a Perfect Game either way.

Also make sure you collect the Curse Ring, which is detailed below.
~êP

Inside the weapon shop, inspect the door in the back to find that it can't be
opened. You have to inspect it nonetheless before you can continue with this
mini quest. Back outside, go over the wooden bridge to the left. The accessory
shop here doesn't sell much of interest, but you can find an item nearby the
man. When you hear a screechy sound, inspect the floor to find the 'Beat-Up
Useless Old Key'. Return to the weapon shop and try to open the door. Tell the
truth to the owner and he'll hand you the Curse Ring.

The Curse Ring is an excellent accessory which increases your stats like this:
Str +35, Mag +25, Dex +15, Vit +15, Spirit + 15, Luck + 10. However, at the
start of a battle you'll automatically be put in Death Sentence, killing the
equipped character within 60 seconds. You can easily counter this by casting
'Death Force' on the character.

Go back downstairs and talk to the dog to proceed with the game. Apparently
Cloud has been swept through the lifestream all the way to Mideel. After several
scenes, take Cid to the Operation Room and form a party.

Immediately go back inside Mideel and explore the house with two men nearby.
Inside you can grab an Elixir from the bed. It doesn't really matter what you
say, and both responses are funny.

North Corel:
-ê
Head over to North Corel and walk all the way back to the Reactor. Defeat the
Attack Squad and pursue the train by alternating between the levers using the
Up + Triangle buttons. When you've caught up, the team automatically jumps over
to the other train.

Each wagon is defended by a fixed enemy encounter:

Wagon 1: Gas Ducter
-ê
Finish it with a powerful attack such as Trine or Magic Breath.

Wagon 2: Gas Ducter x2
-ê
Finish them with a powerful attack such as Trine or Magic Breath.

Wagon 3: Wolfmeister
-ê
Wolfmeister is a unique enemy and has 10ê HP. The quickest method of beating
this giant is to use Laser a few times (alternatively Demi), then use Aqualung
as he's weak against Water.

Wagon 4: Eagle Gun
-ê
Eagle Gun is another unique enemy with 17000 HP. First of all, steal the unique
Warrior Bangle from Eagle Gun, then quickly finish it off with Laser and Magic
Breath.

Wagon 5: Attack Squad
-ê
Quickly defeat the remaining soldier.

After making it to the front, stopping the train is all there's left to do.
Press the following combinations of buttons: Up + Triangle, Down + X, Down + X.
When you arrive at North Corel, depending on how well you performed the
following happens:

1. If you stopped the train: You receive the Huge Materia and the Ultima Materia
   for free.

2. If you made it on the other train, but failed to stop it then you won't
   receive the Huge Materia and you must pay 50ê gil if you want the Ultima
   Materia.

3. If you didn't even make it on the other train, the Huge Materia and Ultima
   Materia are both lost to you. Ultimate fail, literally!

After resting at the Inn, head outside and go into the building on the left.
Speak to the woman with the green hat and she'll hand you Barret's final Limit
Break, Catastrophe.

Fort Condor:
-ê
Enter Fort Condor and talk to the man in charge of the battles. This will be the
very last battle you'll fight here, but there's a better strategy for this
particular fight.

By allowing the enemy to reach the shack you can fight a weak boss named CMD.
Grand Horn. He drops an Imperial Guard, a good and rare armor. 

&lt;Perfect Game Note 24:&gt;
~êP
It is possible (and required for a Perfect Game) to get two unique copies of
unmastered Phoenix Materia:

Do *NOT* go outside to pick up the Phoenix Materia. Instead, leave it alone and
head straight down (you can still speak with the old man at the table to get the
Huge Materia).

On Disc 3, head to Bone Village and search at spot 2 (upper level, to the right
of the ladder) to find the Phoenix Materia (after you've dug up the Buntline
here first). After digging it up, head back to Fort Condor to get the second
unique unmastered copy of Phoenix.

Here is a map with the exact spot (2) to dig at in Bone Village (Disc 3 only):

 êhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/57001

By defeating CMD. Grand Horn you'll also save the day, allowing you to receive
the Huge Materia by talking to the old man at the table in the main area.

Note: If you happen to lose the boss battle it won't be game over. Instead
 êyou're NEVER allowed access to Fort Condor ever again.

|Ultimate Weapon can't be defeated and will flee after several turns. You can  |

| êN|
|If you want to defend yourself from Ultima Beam, you could put an Elemental   |
|Materia, paired with ANY Materia that has no element (like independent ê|
|materia) in your armor. ê7|
'-êN'

After the battle, many scenes take place. You'll eventually find yourself in
control of Tifa as she helps Cloud to remember the memories he has lost or
converted into other thoughts. First visit Nibelheim, then go to the well on
the left. The next piece of story unfolds at Tifa's room on the right, while
the conclusion can be found at Nibelheim. After succeeding in finding Cloud's
real identity, the team is re-united again.

With Mideel destroyed, the shops won't have much left for sale. The crazy
costumer however, who can now be found on the left side of the town, has all
goods for sale that the shops used to sell.

Optional Things:
-ê

Key to Sector 5
-ê
There are a few more optional things you can do at this point. Head back to
Bone Village and order a search. Skip the process of placing diggers, then walk
to the upper level and stand near the ledge, in the middle between the smoke
and the campfire to mark the correct spot. The next morning, collect the Key
Item 'Key to Sector 5' from the chest.

With this key in hand you can revisit Midgar. As you approach the gate it
appears the man here has lost his key. Tough luck! If you go inside the church
you can see Aeris' ghost, but there's nothing else to do around there.

Revisit Wall Market and enter the store that says 'Item'. Inside, try and use
the machine to receive the Premium Heart. It is worthwhile to place both Tifa
and Cid in your party when you attempt this to view a hilarious extra scene.

Pay a visit to the weapon store up north and talk to the man who sold you the
batteries aeons ago. The sucker offers you a new bargain for the not-so-low
price of 129000 gil. Your reward for spitting out this money? The unique Sneak
Glove, and accessory that greatly increases your chances when stealing.

Final Heaven
-ê
Head to Nibelheim with Tifa in your party and go to Tifa's piano. Play the tune
like before: X, [], Triangle, R1+Triangle, R1+[], X, [], Triangle, R1+X, O, X,
[], X, and press start to end. You'll receive Tifa's final Limit Break,
Final Heaven.

Gold Saucer
-ê
The Gold Saucer has finally re-opened again, meaning you can participate in the
Chocobo Races and breed Chocobos more easily. An in-depth guide is available at
the Chocobo Breeding sections.

Four caves on the world map are only accessible by Chocobos (with the exception
of the Quadra Magic Materia cave - see before). The other caves contain Mime,
HP&lt;-&gt;MP, and the famous Knights of Round Materia. Also see section {OPT-7.16}.

There's another Huge Materia stashed away at the Underwater Reactor at Junon.
Enter Junon Harbor and pay the soldier at the elevator the grand amount of 10
gil. Make your way to the main streets and Cloud mentions the cannon is missing.

Walk all the way out of the streets until you reach a grey corridor. Ride the
elevator down and defeat the two Submarine Crew inside. As you exit, two more
soldiers assault you. Continue down the halls since you can't get past the dog
at this time, until you reach the Underwater Reactor. Ride the fancy elevator
deep down the reactor and proceed through several more halls until you reach
several Underwater MP's. You can steal a Shinra Alpha armor from the soldiers
in beige uniform, a half decent piece of armor. At the docks you'll encounter
Reno, who has an unpleasant surprise for you in store.

|

'-êN'

Carry Armor drops the God's Hand, a good weapon for Tifa. Collect the Battle
Trumpet from the chest on the left and approach the second submarine in the
back. Before boarding, first collect the Scimitar and the Leviathan Scales from
the chests on your right. These are missable, so be sure to immediately collect
them. The Scimitar is one of the two weapons that has triple Materia growth,
making it unique.

Enter the submarine, defeating several marines while passing through. When you
get to the bridge you bump into your buddies from the parade - we suggest you
take them hostage as the battle doesn't grant any rewards besides regular battle
spoils.

Check the manual and start the submarine mini game. The most important things
you need to know is that the square button fires torpedoes, triangle increases
your moving speed and cross slows the submarine down. You already start behind
the red submarine that you must wreck, so quickly align yourself behind it,
allow the game to automatically lock on and unload several torpedoes until it
sinks - this only takes a few salvos. In case you lose track of the red sub,
several other yellow submarines will need to be dealt with. Try pressing R1 for
a quick overview in order to locate the red sub once again.

After the mini game you'll have gained a new vehicle, the gray Shinra Submarine!

Note: In case you lose the minigame (by not destroying the red submarine within
 êten minutes), head back to Junon and go through the door that was
 êpreviously blocked by the dog - losing the minigame is the only way to
 êremove the dog and allow access in this elusive area. Here you'll find
 êthat the red submarine has returned, and while the Huge Materia has
 êalready been shipped, you can now seize the red submarine and make it
 êyour own. You will never be able to collect all Huge Materia this way,
 êhowever.

Head back to Junon and ride the elevator. Check the airport to find that you've
just missed your flight. Better catch up quickly!

There are a few things to be explored down there, so let's have a look.

WARNING: The big green creature roaming the sea is Emerald WEAPON, one of the
optional powerhouse bosses in the game. We highly suggest leaving it alone, as
ramming it with the submarine is likely to mean game over if you're not
extremely well prepared.


The Red Wrecked Submarine
-ê
Submerge at Junon and start exploring the southwest depths of the ocean until
you locate the downed red submarine. This nets you the third Huge Materia.


The Sunken Gelnika {OPT-7.7}
-ê
Get in the sub but don't submerge just yet. First sail to the south of Costa
del Sol until you're nearby the Gold Saucer. Submerge here and look around for
a sunken airplane.

Note: There is a 1/8th chance that Emerald WEAPON is lurking in front of the
 êGelnika. If this is the case, emerge and submerge (if necessary multiple
 êtimes) to move Emerald to a different location. Since Emerald can also
 êlurk in front of the Gelnika as you exit the sunken airplane, always save
 êyour game before exiting the area.

Note: The Gelnika is home to some of the most powerful creatures in the game,
 êso be extremely careful as you search the area.

The first hallway has no encounters, a chest with Heaven's Cloud and a Save
Point that is best used right now. Explore the upper room first and walk across
the bridge on the left to grab the Megalixir from the chest on the right. Walk
back and head right to collect an Escort Guard from another chest. Proceed
downstairs and closely check the upper right corner to find the concealed Double
Cut Materia. Lastly, check the upper left corner for a completely hidden chest
containing the Conformer, Yuffie's Ultimate Weapon.

Tip: The Conformer deals damage according to the enemy's level. Because of this
 êfeature, the morph command is not reduced to 1/8th of the regular damage.
 êIn other words, Yuffie can use the morph command at full strength, which
 êis something that will come in handy especially in the Gelnika as you'll
 êsoon find.

From the main hall with the save point, exit to the hall on the left where you
encounter Reno and Rude, who aren't about to let you have any of the treasure
stashed in the cargo room. Equipment that prevents confusion (such as Ribbons)
can be of use in the boss battle.

|-êN|
|Strategy: Before doing anything else, steal the Tough Ring from Reno, and the |
|Ziedrich from Rude. These items are extremely rare and powerful, so they're   |
|well worth stealing. ê:|
| êN|
|After snatching those items, put up Big Guard and start to pummel Reno and ê|
|Rude with powerful attacks. If you use Yuffie she'll be able to sort out ê|
|excellent damage with her Conformer, especially if paired with the Double Cut |
|Materia. Otherwise, simply pound away with powerful summons, enemy skills or  |
|physical attacks. Poisoning and paralyzing them can help, but hard-hitting ê|
|attacks will still end the fight faster. ê&|
| êN|
|Interestingly, Rude will still not attack Tifa. He'll only attack her if she's|
|the last party member standing and even then he'll attack her only 2 out of 3 |
|times. Rude will never use attack magic on Tifa. Sucks to be in love, Rude!   |
|Now kick his butt, Tifa! ê6|
'-êN'

Enter the cargo room after the fight to collect the last few treasures. Find a
Megalixir in the first chest, then walk all the way to the end of the upper
walkway and loot the chest on the very right for the Spirit Lance.

Downstairs lies the Hades Summon Materia nearby the wrecked helicopter. Search
the lower area of the screen to find chests with the Outsider and Highwind,
Cid's final Limit Break.

As far as treasure goes, that's all there is to the Gelnika. However, the
creatures that roam this place can all be morphed into stat-boosting sources
and you can get all six different sources from here, allowing you to boost all
your character's stats to the maximum value of 255.

The hallway where you fought the Turks contains the Bad Rap and Poodler enemies,
which morph in Luck and Speed Sources. The Cargo Room contains Unknown 1, 2, 3
and Serpents, which morph into the other types of sources. If you start morphing
we suggest to use Yuffie with her Conformer, the ideal morphing combination.
More information on stat maxing is available in the stat maxing section of this
guide.


Lucrecia's Cave (Death Penalty &amp; Chaos)
-ê'
Emerge with the sub and sail slightly north of Costa Del Sol until you reach a
desert with a river nearby. Submerge, and head through the tunnel. Emerge at the
end of the tunnel and enter the secret cave behind the waterfall with Vincent in
your party to view a scene.

Return to Lucrecia's Cave after fighting 10 battles and come back here with
Vincent once again to receive the Death Penalty and Chaos, Vincent's Ultimate
Weapon and Limit Break respectively. You can't fight battles just outside the
lake, so you'll have to do that elsewhere.


Key to the Ancients
-ê
This part is not actually optional, but you can postpone it until later in the
game. Submerge with the submarine once again for better navigation and sail over
to nearby Bone Village. Submerge and look around for another tunnel in which you
can find the Key Item the 'Key to the Ancients'. If you check your world map
it is clearly visible that the location of this key is located directly under
the Forgotten Capital, indeed the City of the Ancients.


The Da-chao Fire Cavern
-ê
Head back to Junon and hop back in the Highwind. Fly over to Wutai and go
straight to the Da-chao statues. Remember the cave with the intense flames?
With the Leviathan Scales you collected earlier at the submarine docks you can
now pass these fierce flames, allowing you to reach the Oritsuru - a good weapon
for Yuffie - and the Steal as Well Materia from the back of the flames.

Head over to Rocket Town now. If you didn't get the Fourth Bracelet from the
Weapon Shop, and the Guard Source from the Item shop earlier, do so now. Head to
the Rocket, and Cid will join your party on your way if he isn't already in it.
Beat the several attack squads and climb up. Here you'll face Rude again.

|Strategy: The Attack Squad will only be literally standing in your way, so ê|
|dispatch them first.  Stealing Rude's Ziedrich is a very smart next move, ê|
|considering it's a rare and powerful armor.  To win this battle, follow with  |
|a casting of Big Guard and pummel Rude with your most powerful attacks to ê|
|quickly deplete his HP. ê7|
'-êN'

Inside the rocket you'll be forced to battle one last grunt before entering the
control room.  A few scenes are initiated which will probably have you wondering
how Palmer survived the truck incident.  After the scenes, head right and climb
up to find the last Huge Materia sealed away.  To release the lock, simply
press O, Square, X, X.  Return to the cockpit, then make your way to the escape
pods down below to trigger more scenes.

When you're back in control, return to Rocket Town and talk three times to the
old man who always used to admire his rocket.  He'll go ahead and give you the
Venus Gospel, Cid's Ultimate Weapon.  This weapon's strength is based on how
full Cid's MP is - the more filled his MP is, the stronger the weapon.

In order to proceed with the story you'll need the key item Key to the Ancients.
You might've already gotten this during your exploring in the submarine.  In
case you hadn't, consult the World Map at the end of this book to find its
exact underwater location, essentially directly underneath the Forgotten
Capital. [World map only available in printed edition.]

If you've successfully collected all Huge Materia you'll soon be able to get
extra Materia from them.  If you happened to fail one or more missions you are
awarded Huge Materia according to the mechanics below.

Fail Nothing: êYou will have 4: Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.
Fail 1 Mission:  You will have 3: Yellow, Green, Red.
Fail 2 Missions: You will have 2: Yellow, Green.
Fail 3 Missions: You will have 1: Yellow.
Fail 4 Missions: You will have 0.

Return to Bugenhagen at Cosmo Canyon and he'll safekeep the Huge Materia for
you.  Inspect the Blue Huge Materia, and if you've acquired the Bahamut and
Neo Bahamut Summons it will grant you the Bahamut ZERO Materia.

Note: If you failed any of the prerequisites to obtain the Bahamut ZERO Materia
 êyou'll still be able to dig it up at Bone Village.

Hop back into the Highwind and land it right next to the Forgotten Capital.
Head left at the intersection and head back to the circular room.  Walk to the
center to initiate more scenes and as you try to leave the area the team is
confronted with an abrupt crisis: Diamond Weapon has emerged from the sea and
is headed straight for Midgar!

Back on the world map, wait for Diamond WEAPON to walk ashore.  Bumping the
Highwind into Diamond WEAPON only angers Cid, so trigger the boss battle by
running towards the beast.

Tip: This battle rewards you with a LOT of Experience and AP, so it's a good
 êidea to equip double growth equipment and avoid non-growth equipment such
 êas Ultimate Weapons and certain armor such as the Warrior Bangle and the
 êGigas Armlet.

|-êN|
|Strategy: Diamond WEAPON is invulnerable to physical attacks at the start of  |
|the battle, and this only changes when it counts down to perform its Diamond  |
|Flash attack.  This attack can't kill you since it inflicts 7/8th damage of   |
|your HP, although it does inflict Silence unless you're protected. ê|
| êN|
|Start the battle off by stealing the Rising Sun from Diamond, a unique weapon |
|for Yuffie.  Get your defense rolling with Big Guard and start pounding the   |
|creature with Summons, Comet and Magic Breath, among your other favorite ê|
|attacks.  Bolt3 is an especially effective spell due to Diamond's weakness to |
|lightning-based spells.  Fire-based spells will be halved; keep that in mind. |
|It's possible to slow Diamond WEAPON, although a series of powerful castings  |
|should end this battle soon enough. ê+|
'-êN'

After several more scenes, the story requires you to fly over the Northern
Crater first, followed by flying over Midgar to continue.

Ultimate WEAPON will spawn at the crater nearby Junon after you've dealt with
Diamond WEAPON.  While it's possible to defeat it on Disc 2, destroying it on
Disc 3 is easier as the creature tends to rest at both the Northern Crater and
Midgar, sometimes forcing you to continue with the story.

Once you're all set, fly the Highwind over Midgar to parachute down.  During
this scene you can actually make Cloud roll over in all directions, just for
fun.  On solid ground, proceed to the next screen and head down the ladder.

Explore the upper right of the area first in order to reach a chest with an
Elixir on the left side of the intersection, and a chest with a Megalixir on
the right side.  From your starting position, walk down the long stairs and
climb down the ladder to the next screen.

Make sure to go left first and climb the ridiculously long ladder to reach a
chest with the rare Aegis Armlet.  Take the right path only after collecting all
previously mentioned items (as the floor breaks, forcing you to continue). Head
left, go up the ladder and follow the path until you have to walk through a
tube.  In the next screen, collect an Elixir from the chest to the right and the
Starlight Phone from the chest on the left.

Before heading upstairs, climb down and enter the tube.  This will lead you to
a ladder with the Max Ray on top.  Climb the previously mentioned stairs, save
your game and crawl through the tube to reach the next area.

Tip: Equip your party members with Ribbons to grant immunity to Confusion.

Note: In this area it's possible to avoid the upcoming boss battle with the
 êTurks altogether.  Walk up to the pillar to the right of Cloud as he
 êclimbs out the ventilation shaft.  The ground around this pillar is
 êslightly raised compared to the rest of the tunnel.  Carefully walk around
 êthe pillar by going counter clockwise, and stay on the raised area.
 êThis avoids the 'encounter trigger line' which was programmed lower.

The team meets the Turks one last time, but if you completed the Wutai sidequest
in which Yuffie stole your Materia, you'll be given the option to fight or not.
It is highly advisable to fight this battle, or you'll miss out on a chance to
steal three very rare and valuable pieces of equipment.

|Strategy: Start off by stealing the Tough Ring, Ziedrich and Minerva Band from|
|Reno, Rude and Elena respectively.  Follow up with your favorite defensive ê|
|enemy skill Big Guard and end the battle by casting several powerful summons, |
|or by simply pounding away with powerful physical attacks if some of your ê|

| êN|
|You'll want to stay away from Lighting, Ice and Fire attacks to avoid healing |
|any one of the Turks.  Keep in mind that the others will flee as soon as you  |

|a decent amount of Experience and AP, try wiping them out all at once with a  |

'-êN'

After the battle you can actually choose which way you go.  The story requires
you to head up, but going down the tunnels nets you several very useful items.
Keep your eyes out for chests holding a Power Source, Guard Source, Mind Source
and Magic Source.  The W-Item Materia can be found at the very far lower end of
the tunnels.

Tip: The W-Item Materia allows you to duplicate any item that can be used in
 êbattle, and with an advanced technique even items that cannot be used
 êin battle.  To duplicate an item that can be used in battle, follow these
 êinstructions:

 êSuppose you have 1 Megalixir that you want to duplicate.  Fight a battle
 êand have someone equipped with the W-Item Materia.  Select the W-Item
 êcommand, select the Megalixir and use it.  Then move your cursor to any
 êother item you can use and press Circle.  After this, press X to cancel.
 êYou'll now have two Megalixirs. Press Circle, X, Circle, X and repeat to
 êduplicate the Megalixir to a maximum of 99.  You only need one copy of an
 êitem to be able to duplicate it.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 25:&gt;
~êP
Make sure you steal 99 Graviballs from Shadow Makers in the tunnels. Of course,
with the W-Item Materia, life's a lot easier.
~êP

Backtrack to the tunnel where you fought the Turks.  This screen has a ladder
on the left side.  From here, head north to reach an intersection.  The optional
Shinra Building is located to the right, but it's your very last chance to
revisit it and collect many rare items.

After going right at the intersection you'll reach another fork.  The right path
leads to a dead end, so continue left to reach Shinra's HQ.  If you take your
time to walk the long stairs once again, your reward will be the unique and
elusive Behemoth Horn for Red XIII.  Whether you did or didn't pick up the
Elixir during your first visit doesn't matter.  In fact, you can also collect
this if you hadn't before.

Going through the main entrance, make sure you read the Turtle's Paradise Flyer
No.2 if you hadn't during you first visit.  Walk the stairs up to the second
floor and explore the item shop behind the green doors in the corner.  With the
lady absent you can now collect the Pile Bunker and Master first from these two
chests.

Ride the glass elevator at the first floor's entrance lobby to the 63rd floor
and collect the Grow Lance from one of the rooms.  The 64th floor is also worth
a visit.  Check out the vending machine in the upper left corner of the fitness
room to receive a Mind Source and a Speed Source.  Definitely collect the HP
Shout from the last row of the locker room, which is Cait Sith's Ultimate
Weapon.  This is your only chance of collecting it.

While you can further climb the stairs to reach the highest floors, you can
never fully access these seemingly unchanged floors.  Backtrack to the tunnel
intersection and follow the left path to continue with the story.  Climb up and
the team is interrupted by the new toy of Scarlet and Heidegger; Proud Clod.

The next screen contains an Elixir and the Mystile armor in chests.  The Mystile
is arguably the best armor in the game with the highest evasion stats of any
armor, normally allowing you to dodge over half the attacks thrown at you.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 26:&gt;
~êP
Steal 99 of the 8inch Cannon item, from Grosspanzer.  This enemy can be found
anywhere on this screen with the save point.  Of course, the W-Item Trick can
save you a lot of time as one copy of the item will do fine.

Feel free to save your game and place Barret in your party, if only for a short

in the next screen.  Either swap or keep Barret in your party after collecting
it.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 28:&gt;
~êP
In this area, steal 99 Shinra Alpha's from SOLDIER:1st.  You can increase the
steal rate slightly with the Sneak Glove if you have it.  Cranking the battle
speed up to the max also shaves off some time.
~êP

The stairs lead you to Hojo, who isn't about to give up without a fight.  Equip
your characters with Ribbon(s) and (high-levelled) Counter Attack Materias.

|-êN|
|Strategy: The fight with Hojo consists of three phases.  Equipping your ê|
|characters with Ribbons will make the battles easier. ê|
| êN|
|The first phase is easy, and Hojo will only use a capsule to spawn two sample |
|creatures.  Kill Hojo and his samples will go down with him. ê|
| êN|
|The second form is tougher and has two separate arms you can target.  The arms|
|will revive quickly after dispatching them, so it's best to focus on the main |
|body.  Attacks such as Magic Breath deal solid damage and are a nice change of|
|just physical attacks. ê8|
| êN|
|The third form is the most dangerous and attacks with a physical combo which  |
|hits four consecutive times and inflicts Poison, Darkness and Sleep.  If you  |
|equip your characters with Counter Attack Materia you'll get a chance to ê|
|counter each single attack from the combo.  Magical attacks are countered by  |
|Hojo with a casting of Silence, although protective gear will help you avoid  |
|this nuisance.  Hojo is vulnerable to Stop, although pounding away with hard  |
|hitting physical attacks and strong summons will soon fell him. ê|

It's possible to exit the Northern Crater at any time, even after entering, and
there are various optional things left to do in the world. Refer to the next
section to view your options.

Climb down the ladder and walk down the rocky steps.  Confirm to enter the
crater and Cloud will automatically venture down.  A word of advice beforehand:
There are several enemies in the crater which have instant-death attacks, and
since Ribbons do *not* protect against sudden death, equip at least one of your
characters with a Safety Bit.

Tip: If you want to exit the crater, simply enter the first cave doorway and
 êclimb up.  You can do this any time you like.

Collect the Save Crystal from the first chest.  This item allows you to create
one Save Point anywhere in the Northern Crater.  Since you can only do this
*once*, think ahead before using it.  We'll give you some advice later.

Note: There's a known glitch where you don't obtain the Save Crystal.  It's
 êfairly uncommon, but we'll detail it in any case.  It occurs if you open
 êthe chest of the Save Crystal while the animation of rocks falling down
 êis still in motion.  The text 'Received Save Crystal!' will still appear,
 êbut you can still move around.  If you exit the crater through the cave
 êdoorway, the Save Crystal is not saved to your inventory.  You can never
 êobtain another Save Crystal afterwards.

Walk down the spiral path and grab a Guard Source from the second chest. You can
also learn the Dragon Force enemy skill from Dark Dragons here. When you get to
the next screen, you can choose to go down by the left or right side. First head
down by the right side and collect a Guard Source from the chest. Jump down and
head back on the right to grab a Mind Source from the lonely chest. Now head
back up via the left side, and collect the Magic Source from the first chest.
Climb up some more to find an Elixir inside the next chest you pass by. The
chest on the upper left contains a Power Source, and if you walk to the right
from this ledge you can also grab the shiny HP Absorb Materia.  To exit, proceed
to the next screen through the bottom of this area.

The next area looks like a maze, but it's fairly easy to navigate.  Jump off the
small ledge (which you can jump up to at any time you'd like).  From here you
can go left or right.

Go right first and Cloud will drop down.  Collect a Mind Source from the chest
to your left, then stand on the right end of the ledge - facing left - and jump
up.  Walk to the other side and enter the cave to find a Megalixir.  Exit the
cave and walk a little to the left to drop down to a lower level, allowing you
to collect a Hero Drink from the chest to the right.

Enter the cave and collect the Guard Source inside another chest.  The other
chest can be accessed by going through the tunnel, of which the entrance can be
found slightly under the chest - it holds a Power Source.  Exit the cave by the
top of the screen, walk right and drop down.

This time drop down more and enter the cave.  Proceed through the connecting
path, drop down some more and stay on the right side of the screen.  When you've
reached the bottom, near the exit below, consider placing the Save Point here.
It's approximately at the middle of the Northern Crater, so you can go anywhere
from here.  Alternatively, place the Save Point at the bottom of the crater.
Whatever you do, don't place it at the next intersection.  People have reported
that they weren't able to climb out of the crater anymore because of placing
the Save Point in that screen.

Tip: You'll need to split up your party at this point, and depending on who
 êyou send which direction you can get duplicate copies of very rare items.
 êFollow these instructions carefully:

&lt;Perfect Game Note 29:&gt;
~êP
Depending on what type of Perfect Game you're doing - with or without the
extended W-Item trick - you'll need to send your party members down in different
manners:

o Perfect Game Without extended W-Item trick:
  =ê+
  - This requires you to get a duplicate of the Mystile, Imperial Guard,
 êthe Shield Materia and the (Command) Counter Materia. The following
 êinstructions yield this result:

 êCloud: Left/Down
 êBarret: Left/Up
 êTifa: Right
 êRed XIII: Left/Up
 êCait Sith: Left/Down
 êYuffie: Left/Up
 êVincent: Left/Down
 êCid: Left/Up
 ê
  - Now take Cloud down through the lowest path on the screen.

o Perfect Game WITH extended W-Item trick:
  =ê(
  - This does NOT require you to get duplicates of the Mystile and Imperial
 êGuard, since you can duplicate these with the extended W-Item trick.
 êAs such, you'll need duplicates of the Shield Materia, the (Command) Counter
 êMateria, AND the Mega All Materia. There are specific instructions to do
 êthis, which differ from the above.

  - The reason why the instructions for this combination of treasure are
 êdifferent is because once you send Cloud down the right path (which we are
 êrequired to do in this scenario), all party members who are sent down the
 êleft path have a 50/50 chance to give one of the two possible items they
 êcan give you. This means you could either try several times and get lucky,
 ê(the chance is 12.5%) or carefully follow the instructions below:

  - First of all, send Cloud right, and send Red XIII, Yuffie, and Vincent
 êleft.  It doesn't matter which way you send any other party members.
  
  - Head down to the bottom of the crater (where the paths intersect). Don't
 êmeet up with the rest of the gang; instead, backtrack through the 2 o'clock
 êexit and collect all items on both unexplored paths (including Mega-All,
 êShield, and Counter).
 ê
  - Head back to the Highwind after this. Save your game, and do a hard reset.
 êNow load your game and head back to the crater.
 ê
  - This part is slightly more tricky. When you pass through the spiral descent
 êfield (the one where you found the Save Crystal) make sure you RUN with
 êCloud (don't walk), don't get stuck, don't stop to open chests, and don't
 êtake the longest route (in other words, don't hug the wall and get down
 êASAP). [All of this is necessary to get a specific &quot;random&quot; result.]
 ê
  - At the field where your party initially split, take the RIGHT path.
  
  - At the bottom of the crater (where the paths merge), do the following:
 êEnter and instantly exit the 2 o'clock path SIX times.
 ê
  - That's it! You can now meet up with your teammates at the rendezvous.
 êThe items you receive should be:
 ê
 êBarret: Remedy
 êTifa: Hero Drink
 êRed XIII: Shield Materia
 êYuffie: Counter Materia
 êCait Sith: Remedy
 êVincent: Mega-All Materia
 êCid: Elixir
~êP

Note: In the 2012 PC version, if you place the Save Crystal at the first screen
 êafter going down from the main intersection (where you'll reach the
 êsecond intersection), the name of this room will change to 'Secret Cow
 êLevel'. If you save your game, this is also displayed on your save file.
 êExiting/re-entering the room will reset the name.
 ê
 êImportant: Don't use the Save Crystal just yet if you want to exploit it
 êfor certain Materia duplication.

This guide assumes you're going down the Left-Down path first. You may (or may
not) have a weak party right now, so be extra careful. It can be wise to equip
Vincent and Cait Sith with the Ziedrich, if you never used them often. This
armor will cut down most damage in half, plus raises defense by a great deal. To
further boost defense you could also give them a Tough Ring.

Head down the steps and collect a Remedy from the chest on the left.  The next
chest contains an Elixir, and the third chest in this area contains an X-Potion.
Inside the next screen, follow the path until you get to jump down twice.

If you jump off from the left, just make sure to grab the items from the chests.
The nearby one contains a Turbo Ether.  Head right to collect a Vaccine on the
way.  Make sure you collect the Magic Counter Materia from the Mako stream to
the very left.

Note: On the next screen, if you haven't used the Save Crystal yet, you can
 êtake advantage of a glitch that allows you to use the Save Crystal to
 êcreate a Save Point, while still keeping the actual Save Crystal item.

In the next screen, jump down to grab the X-Potion from the chest. Follow the
fairly linear path down until you get to the second chest that holds a Turbo
Ether. From here, continue left. Cloud will double jump over to the next
platform, so in order to collect the Mega All Materia, tap Circle repeatedly
during the jump.  The chest on the left contains a Speed Source.  Jump down and
exit the screen.  This next screen is the bottom of the Northern Crater.  Do NOT
go anywhere except the way you just came from (if you care about duplicating
several treasures in the Crater - otherwise just finish the game).

Backtrack all the way you came until you are at the screen where your party
members split up.  Go down the right path, which is the path you sent Tifa down.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 30:&gt;
~êP
It's wise to equip one character (for example Cloud) with all 4 Enemy Skill
Materia during this part. You could encounter a Dragon Zombie, which uses the
Enemy Skill 'Pandora's Box' as a Final Attack. However, once it uses this Final
Attack, no other Dragon Zombies will ever perform this attack again due to a
certain variable. If you have all Enemy Skill Materias on Cloud, all the Materia
will get the skill at once. After that you'll never have to worry about missing
any enemy skill again as all others can still be gotten (unless you already
missed Trine from Godo).
~êP

Walk down the spiral path and climb down at the end. Grab the Mystile armor from
the chest, and the Elixir on the ground.  Head down the last spiral to the next
screen.  The chest on the right contains a Tetra Elemental and the other chest
on the left contains a Speed Source.  The very left part of the screen contains
a chest with a Megalixir, as does the last chest of this area.

Exit the screen by the north and walk down the large skeleton.  When you reach
the bottom of the crater, once again do *not* proceed to the center, but
backtrack through the path that you first took, in other words go through the
exit closest by.  When you've backtracked to the screen where the 'left path'
splits up into an upper and lower path, choose the upper path.

This swampy area is roaming with strange creatures, many of which grant a lot
of AP when defeated, such as Magic Pots and Movers.  Follow the lower path
to reach a chest containing a Magic Source, then proceed over the upper path
to make Cloud run through the water.  Collect a Remedy from the other chest and
exit the screen.

Take the upper path first and collect the green Shield Materia.  From this spot,
walk more down to the left and Cloud will go through the water again, reaching
the chest with an Imperial Guard.  Note that going south from this chest will
lead to the right side of the area.  The other chest on the upper left contains
a Vaccine.  Walk all the way right to collect a Hero Drink, then exit the area.

The next room houses the Counter Materia in the middle.  Note that this is not
the same as the 'Counter attack' Materia.  This Counter Materia is a support
Materia which will counter with any paired command (yellow) materia.  There's
one other Materia in this area, however, and it's slightly difficult to spot.
Explore the very far north area and look around for a very tiny orb to collect
the W-Magic Materia.

You're now back at the bottom of the crater, and you're free to do however you
please.  Collect the Luck Source from the chest and meet up with your party
members at the center.  If you followed the instructions you should get the
following duplicate items from them:

Tifa: 'Mythril' (This is actually a Mystile)
Cid: Imperial Guard
Barret: Vaccine
Red XIII: Shield Materia
Yuffie: (Command) Counter Materia

There are plenty of optional things to do, so here's a small list of optional
things you can do, provided you haven't done some of them already.

o You can breed and race chocobos. Many rare items can be acquired by winning
  Chocobo Races and exploring the four Materia Caves on the world map. Refer to
  sections {M1.4} &amp; {M2}.

o You can get Red XIII's Ultimate Weapon Limited Moon from Bugenhagen. The
  backroom of the Item Shop is also explorable if you hadn't already looted it.

o Ultimate WEAPON has spawned above the crater lake nearby Junon after you
  defeated Diamond WEAPON. After each battle it will always first spawn above
  lake Junon (but it'll immediately start moving, so quickly move there), after
  which you'll have to ram into it several times to force it to another fixed
  point where it can be fought.

o The Ancient Forest can be visited (either after defeating Ultimate WEAPON or
  by breeding a mountain chocobo).

o A hidden scene can be viewed by revisiting the library in the basement of the
  Shinra Building at Nibelheim.

o The Special Battle at the Gold Saucer's Battle Square can be attempted after:
  1. Collecting and learning Omnislash with Cloud.
  2. Collecting Ultimate Weapon by defeating Ultimate WEAPON.
  3. Collecting the W-Summon Materia from the prize list.

  If you win the special battle, which can only be fought with Cloud, you'll
  receive the Final Attack Materia.  Winning the special battle 10 times nets
  you a Ribbon.

o Emerald WEAPON can be fought against, although this battle requires thorough
  preparations.  Ruby WEAPON spawns in the sands around the Gold Saucer after
  defeating Ultimate WEAPON and fighting one random battle after that.
  Beating these two creatures also allows you to complete the Kalm Traveller's
  Quest.

o There are more things to do, but the above are most profound.

It helps to equip your main party members with Ribbons.  If you don't have three
Ribbons, morph a Master Tonberry into one, or if you want to go out of the
crater, morph a Ho-Chu at the special battle of the Gold Saucer's Battle Square,
second battle.

When you're absolutely sure you're ready to finish the game, speak with your
party members and move out.

You'll have to jump from stone to stone, often facing Dragon Zombie and Iron Man
enemies.  Both are far stronger than regular enemies and serve as semi-bosses,
but the Dragon Zombie is an undead creature and can easily be disposed of with
White Wind or healing items.  Iron Man is weak against water, so Aqualung is an
effective attack to use against them.  Big Guard will greatly help reduce damage
from their powerful swipes.  Iron Man morphs into an Escort Guard.

-êP
The exact mechanics of encounters while jumping from platform to platform are as
follows:

Every time you hop to a new platform, you have a 76/256 (29.69%) chance of
being attacked.  If you are attacked, the enemy will be one of the following:

 ê1x Allemagne: ê26/256 (10.2%) chance
 ê1x Iron Man: ê128/256 (50.0%) chance
 ê1x Dragon Zombie:   102/256 (39.8%) chance

The first screen has 5 jumps and the second screen has 8 jumps.

|Strategy: This battle is surprisingly easy and Jenova's attacks are all ê|

|wait five turns. ê>|
| êN|
|A casting of Knights of Round will obliterate Jenova, but also has a large ê|

|equally fine. êA|
'-êN'

The team floats down the very bottom of the crater, where Sephiroth resides.
You're now given the option to re-equip your party members.

It's advisable to give your main party the best equipment you have, even if the
upcoming battle has you fighting with more than one party.  If that's the case,
simply ignore the other parties and continue to fight with your main party.
The best armor and accessory are respectively the Mystile and Ribbon.

|Strategy: While there are various strategies possible, based on how many ê|
|parties you use when fighting Sephiroth, the easiest is by far to simply use  |
|your main party and inflict as much damage as possible in a short period. ê|
| êN|
|The idea is normally to destroy the Core (Bizarro*Sephiroth C), which heals   |
|the Main Body (A) every turn for about 6500.  The Core is invulnerable until  |
|Right and Left Magic (D and E) have been destroyed.  When you fight with two  |
|parties you'll need to destroy two sides of the core and when you fight with  |
|three parties you must destroy three parts of the core.  To view the names of |
|all different, press [SELECT] to bring up th help bar. ê|
| êN|
|It's advisable to outdamage the Main Body and ignore the healing Core ê	|
|completely by using Knights of Round, Bahamut, Double or 4x Cut, Comet 2 and  |
|everything else that hits Sephiroth hard.  Big Guard takes care of your ê|
|defense, while effective castings of White Wind should keep your party's HP   |
|high. êI|

|Strategy: The fight against Safer Sephiroth counts as the final battle of ê|
|Final Fantasy VII.  This means you can give it all you've got, there is no ê|
|reason to conserve that Megalixir you stored away for ages.  Use everything   |

| êN|
|Sephiroth always starts the battle with Wall.  A De-spell will effectively ê|

|Casting Slow on Safer Sephiroth in the early going is a decent idea as well.  |

| êN|
|Sephiroth eventually casts his ultimate attack, Supernova, which cannot ê|
|actually kill you since it deals 15/16th damage of your current HP.  It ê|
|normally inflicts confusion, silence and slow as well, although Ribbons ê|
|counter this.  A Megalixir is the perfect cure against Supernova. ê|
| êN|
|To damage Sephiroth, use powerful summons and physical attacks, but keep in   |
|mind that when Sephiroth has ascended, characters without the long range ê|
|ability won't be able to hit him.  Coin also works wonders, especially since  |
|you can throw as much at him as you'd like.  If you really want to mop the ê|
|floor with Sephiroth, a few castings of Knights of Round will easily do him   |
|in. êK|
'-êN'

After destroying Safer Sephiroth, the game will confront Cloud with one final
battle which cannot be lost.  The only attack available to Sephiroth is an
attack that inflicts 31/32nd damage of Cloud's HP (after which Cloud will
automatically counterattack with a physical attack).

In this section, both the stories of the main characters in Final Fantasy 7,
as well as their statistics and character data are listed. It isn't meant as
a full story analysis and mostly goes into (some of) the origins of the main
characters' names.

As for the stats and the % that are in the tables, you may wonder how this was
derived from the game. Without going in the mechanics with too much specifics,
it suffices to say that I took the min/max margins for the stats, calculated the
average of the stat when looking at all 9 characters, and then checked how much
the characters differed from that average.

The indications (Low, High, Average) are different for HP/MP on the one hand,
and stats (Strength, Vitality, etc) on the other hand. For example, +5% is
considered Very High for HP/MP, but only +10% will qualify as Very High for
stats. Keep in mind that the comparisons in this section only reflect natural
stat growth. The maxing out of your characters' statistics is something else
entirely.

Storyline:
-ê

Cloud Strife is the main character of Final Fantasy VII. Cloud was born in
Nibelheim, where he grew up with Tifa. He grew up rather isolated from the other
children in Nibelheim, including Tifa. Cloud felt himself better than them,
although he longed for friendship. When Tifa and the other children tried to
climb Mt. Nibel, Cloud was the only one to come for her. He also makes the
promise to Tifa that he will come for her when he is strong and when he is the
number one SOLDIER in Shinra, just like Sephiroth.

Cloud never made it in SOLDIER. Instead, he became a normal Shinra guard. An
important assignment is the one where he must investigate a problem at the
Nibelheim Mako Reactor. At first, the player of the game is told that it was
Cloud who accompanied Sephiroth. Later in the game, Cloud's role appears to have
been much less prominent, when is revealed that it was actually Zack and
Sephiroth who were the leading roles during the Nibelheim incident. Cloud was
one of the normal Shinra guards, so he did see everything that happened.

Upon reaching the reactor, Sephiroth finds out about Hojo's failed experiments,
which were about infusing SOLDIERS with Mako and Jenova Cells. Sephiroth goes on
a rampage and burns Nibelheim, killing both Cloud and Tifa's parents. Tifa's
father is killed in the reactor, after which Tifa gets wounded by Sephiroth. By
then, Zack is also already wounded by Sephiroth, and it looks like all hope is
lost. But then Cloud comes for her, and in a fight with Sephiroth he somehow
manages to survive Sephiroth's stab, and he throws Sephiroth into bottoms of the
reactor, essentially the Lifestream.

After this, both wounded Cloud and Zack were brought to the Shinra Mansion, and
Professor Hojo from Shinra started horrible experiments on them, putting them in
the Mako tubes. Fortunately, Zack finds himself strong enough (after a long
time) to escape from the tube, and he frees Cloud. They set off to Midgar, on
the run for Shinra. Close to Midgar, Zack dies by an overwhelming power of
Shinra grunts. Cloud is left for dead. Cloud manages to get himself to Midgar,
grabbing Zack's Buster Sword. Tifa finds him, and the story of FFVII begins.

It turns out that Cloud suffers from a mixture of amnesia and mind control.
Because Cloud has had enormous amounts of Mako infused cells, along with Jenova
Cells, Sephiroth can control Cloud sometimes. The voices inside Cloud's head are
in fact no one else than the real Cloud, who remembers how everything went in
the past.

Storyline:

Barret grew up in the coal mining village Corel. Everything was at peace, until
one day Shinra company wanted to build a Mako reactor. Barret was one of the
people negotiating about it, and he didn't see the cons of the project.. yet.
His best friend Dyne on the other hand, was all against it. When the reactor
was built, anti-Shinra terrorists (also known as AVALANCHE) attacked the
reactor. Shinra's countermeasure was to burn Corel to the ground, killing many
innocents.

Barret and Dyne saw the village burn from a distance, and on their return they
were attacked by Scarlet and Shinra troops. In the process, both Barret and
Dyne lost their arm. Dyne fell from a cliff and Barret thought he was dead.
Barret later replaced his lost arm with a prosthetic gun arm. He also adopted
Marlene, the daughter of Dyne, who was still alive.

Barret becomes the leader of the second incarnation of AVALANCHE, swearing
revenge on Shinra. During the game, Barret's character changes somewhat when
he realizes that he doesn't get his family back with revenge.

Storyline:
-ê

Tifa grew up in Nibelheim as Cloud's neighbor. Because of circumstances, they
never really got close. When Tifa's mom died when Tifa was 8 years old, Tifa
went looking for her through Mount Nibel, believing her spirit passed though.
Cloud was the only one who came for her, but it results in both of them falling
down a bridge. Tifa went into a coma for week. Cloud got the blame for the
accident by Tifa's father, and their relationship remained distant.

When Cloud was 14 he asked Tifa to come to the well one night, He told Tifa
about his plans of becoming a SOLDIER. Tifa was surprised and disappointed both
and she asked him to promise that he would come for her if she ever was in
trouble.

After Cloud left, Tifa started to wonder about Cloud, even though they never
really were close. She began reading newspapers looking for a story about
Cloud.

When Tifa was 15, she was the guide for a group of Shinra SOLDIERs who were
sent to inspect the reactor in Mount Nibelheim, where an incident had happened.
This group consisted of Sephiroth, Zack, and two Shinra grunts. Tifa didn't
know that Cloud was in fact one of these grunts. Cloud, in shame, did not
reveal his identity to her.

Sephiroth discovers several disturbing things about his past, and he burns
Nibelheim to the ground. He also kills Tifa's father in the reactor. Tifa also
rushes to the reactor, but gets seriously injured by Sephiroth. Cloud then
comes to the rescue, laying her on a safer spot, after which he confronts
Sephiroth. He gets stabbed, though with all his strength he slams him in the
depths of the reactor (the lifestream). Tifa is then rescued by her martial
arts teacher Zangan, who brings her to Midgar where he leaves her with a
doctor.

In Midgar, Tifa recovers from her injury and sets up the bar '7th Heaven'. She
meets Barret here, who she joins AVALANCHE with so she can get revenge on
Shinra.

Shortly before the game begins, Tifa finds a rather sick and confused Cloud at
the train station. It's the first time she has seen him in 7 years, although
Cloud tells her it's only been 5 (Cloud remembers the whole Nibelheim incident
vaguely, while Tifa doesn't know he had been there). Tifa quickly found out
there were many things Cloud couldn't have known, so she offered him the job
at AVALANCHE just to get more time to figure out the mysteries behind Cloud,
and also, of course, to look after him.

the land and lifestyles of those living on the River.  According to legend, the
Danish King Canute tried to reverse this tide at Gainsborough, in honor of his

Aeris is a flower girl in the Midgar Slums. She lives with her adoptive mother,
Elmyra Gainsborough. Her real mother, Ifalna, was the last surviving Ancient of
the planet. She left her daughter the White Materia, which Aeris doesn't know
how to use for a long time. Her father is Professor Gast, who found Ifalna in
Icicle Inn.

Hojo had Professor Gast shot and Elmyra and Aeris taken to the Shinra HQ. It
was seven years later they escaped, but they didn't get far. At the train
station of sector 5, where Elmyra was waiting for her man to return from the
war with Wutai. Instead she found Aeris and her wounded mother.

Five years before the start of the game, Aeris meets Zack and they fall in love
with each other. It is unknown how long they've dated, but it was a quite
serious relationship.

In Midgar, Aeris is often pursued by the Turks. One day, Cloud crashed down the
roof of the church, and helps Aeris escape. This gets the two involved in the
adventure you know as Final Fantasy 7.

In Hindi, Nanaki means &quot;sister of Nanaka.&quot;  We know that Red XIII is male, but
there is no real Japanese equivalent to the name.  Given that, Nanaka means
&quot;Guru of Sikhs,&quot; which Red XIII may very well grow up to be as some sort of
shaman tribal leader.  According to the Hindi beliefs of naming your children,
Nanaka and Nanaki would both grow up to be people who yearn for association with
new people and actions, though the reality of these situations will be rather
bitter.  The child would be quick-witted, desire change and travel, and enjoy
any opportunity to be creative and independent in favor of conformation to

RedXIII is a powerful beast with the ability to speak. His real name is Nanaki,
and RedXIII is just the name Hojo gave him. Hojo attempted to mate RedXIII with
Aeris, seeing how 'both are endangered species'.

RedXIII is the oldest member of the party with his 48 years old, but he is only
an adolescent because he ages very slowly. His species can become over 500
years old, in fact RedXIII lives at least 548 years.. :)

RedXIII believed that his father, Seto, was a coward when his tribe was at war
with the Gi Tribe. At Cosmo Canyon, RedXIII discovers that Seto didn't ran away
but actually fought with his life to protect his family, until the spears
turned him to stone.

Bugenhagen is an important figure in RedXIII's life. He even refers to him as
his grandfather.

pronounced Kaht Shee (Scottish Gaelic) or Cahd See (Irish).  Modern zoology
suggests that the fuel for these legends were the Kellas Cats: hybrids of 
domesticated English cats and Highland Wildcats, a breed going back as many as
fifteen hundred years.



In-battle/Stat-wise: êSummary:
-ê. -ê
HP: êAverage (-0.1%) ê| Cait Sith is actually an avid magic user. His
MP: êAverage (-1%) ê| physical stats lack somewhat, and his magic
Strength:  Average (+6.4%) ê| stats make up for that.
Vitality:  Low (-9.1%) ê|
Magic: êAbove Avg (+2.8%)  | Cait Sith is probably best put in the back row.
Spirit: êAbove Avg (+4%) ê| He has rather low physical defense, so putting
Dexterity: Very Low (-10.1%)  | him there is an excellent countermeasure. If
Luck: êBelow Avg (-3.9%)  | you use Cait Sith as a Magic user, then this
-ê' doesn't even affect his power.

Storyline:
-ê

Cait Sith rides/sits on a large moogle. Cait Sith is actually 'only' a toy cat,
which is under the control of Reeve, one of the top Shinra characters.

Cait Sith joins the party in the Gold Saucer. He 'sacrifices' himself at the
Temple of the Ancients, but a new version quickly shows up.

He's basically the 'black sheep' of the party, seeing how he betrays the party
on several occasions. In the end he proves to be a useful and powerful ally.

Storyline:
-ê

Cid dreamt of flying to outer space since his childhood. He had an opportunity
when the Shinra Space Program was initiated, however Cid had to cancel the
launch because of Shera, who was repairing a malfunctioning tank. Cid always
held this grudge against Shera, while Shera actually loves Cid very much. She
has devoted her life to him, pretty much.

Cid is the single most swearing character in FF7, even more so than Barret. Cid
looks and acts tough, smoking a cig after each battle. But is heart is in the
right place. He has a passion for flying and he's also the captain of the
Highwind. He also becomes the party leader for a while during Cloud's absence.

Storyline:
-ê

Vincent was a Turk, working for Shinra 30 years before the start of the game.
He was assigned to the Jenova Project. During this time, it was that he fell
in love with a scientist named Lucrecia.

His love was not returned, and Lucrecia got into a relationship with Hojo.
After she got pregnant (of Sephiroth), Hojo used their child to experiment on.

Vincent wanted to put an end to this but got shot by Hojo, after which he was
experimented on by, who else, Hojo. When Vincent awoke, he felt like he had to
pay for his sin, and he locked himself in a coffin.

His body doesn't age. Therefore, Vincent's real age is in fact 57 during FF7.

 ê'-ê'-ê	'-ê'

The first screen contains three games: Arm Wrestler, Super Dunk and the Wonder
Catchers.

-ê.
Arm Wrestler | Cost: 100 gil
-ê'

There are 2 opponents you can choose from. The goal here is to tap circle as
fast as possible to beat your opponent.

Sumo Wrestler = Easy,   Reward = 1 GP
Wrestler ê= Medium, Reward = 2 GP

-ê.
Super Dunk   | Cost: 200 gil
-ê'

This basketball game requires you to throw the basketball in the basket by
timing Cloud's strength carefully. You build up strength by holding the circle
button down and releasing it at the right time. The trick here is to hold circle
about a second - in other words until the exact moment that Cloud stops moving.
This is best spotted as seeing the ball touch Cloud's spiky hair. Release the
button at the very time and Cloud scores a point.

The possibilities are as follows:
-ê
Miss (too little power)
Hit  (direct hit)
Hit  (goes against the board, then hits)
Miss (too much power)

For every score you get 1 GP. After every 10 throws you'll be asked if you want
to play Double Chance. If you hit during Double Chance you'll effectively double
your GP, but if you miss you walk away with only 1 GP. The game plays according
to the following scheme:

10 hits --&gt; Double Chance (20GP) --&gt; 10 hits --&gt; Double Chance(60GP) --&gt; 10 hits
--&gt; Double Chance (140GP) --&gt; 10 hits --&gt; Double Chance (300GP). The maximum
amount of GP you can thus win is 300 GP. Super Dunk makes for an *excellent*
method of racking up high amounts of GP early in the game (44 hits = 300 GP!).

-ê.
Wonder Catcher   | Cost: 100 gil
-ê'
On the upper left of the first screen you can try your luck on a Wonder Catcher.
There's only one catcher that isn't occupied (and which you can use), but you
can play from either the left or right side for 100 gil. The prizes you can win
and the chances to win them are as follows:

 ê.-ê.-ê.
 ê|Left Side Prizes: |Right Side Prizes: ê|
 ê|-ê|-ê|
 ê|Potion   (100/256)|Potion ê(100/256)|
 ê|Nothing   (75/256)|Nothing ê(75/256)|

 ê|80 GP ê(1/256)|100 GP ê	(1/256)|
 ê'-ê'-ê'

*Note: The game says you receive an Ether on the Left Catcher, but you actually
-ê receive a Phoenix Down. Same for the right side when the game says you
 êreceive a Phoenix Down; You'll actually receive an Ether. The in-game
 êtext is wrong.

-ê	.
G-Bike   | Cost: 200 gil
-ê	'

This is the motorcycle chase minigame you played during the escape from Shinra
Building. The goal is slightly different this time. You must still try and
protect the car from the bikers while at the same time down as many bikers you
possibly can.

There are two types of bikers: Orange and red colored bikers, which have
somewhat different AI's. While the orange bikers dive in the action and try to
deal as much damage to the car as possible, the red bikers try to distract and
drive you away from the car. It's important to quickly dispatch bikers as they
come on screen to ensure a maximum score. Go for a domino effect when a group of
bikers draws closer to you and the car.

You score 500 points per dispatched biker. When the car is hit you lose 25
points.

-ê.
Mog's House   | Cost: 100 gil
-ê'

It's not terribly difficult to guess where this game is located. It's basically
the tale of a Mog who meets his true love. In order to advance the story you
need to feed Mog the right amount of Kupo Nuts. You can tell when he's had
enough when he makes a squeaking sound that is different from the sound he makes
before that. In other words, feed Mog 5 Kupo Nuts the first time and 3 Kupo Nuts
the second time to finish this game. After beating Mog's House, talk to the man
who watched over your shoulder and he'll give you 30 GP - this is only given
once. Additional plays of Mog House are therefore hard to justify, unless you
wholeheartedly love the game. No, we don't frown on that.. Really!

-ê.
3-D Battler   | Cost: 200 gil
-ê'

Imagine Rock, Paper, Scissors mixed with a virtual boxing game to get the 3-D
Battler as a final result. Add in this mix an extremely unfair AI and you'll
understand why this isn't anyone's favorite game to play. The whole game is
purely based on luck, and chance determines whether you can beat an opponent or
not. See the table below for the different kind of attacks:

 .-ê.-ê4.
 |X = Lower punch; ê| Beats Middle; Loses to High; Ties with Lower Punch |

For example, beating the Fat wrestler (the 2nd opponent) nets you 3 GP.  The

which cannot be defeated.  Losing the fifth battle still nets you the prize
for winning the fourth battle: 300 GP.

The snowboarding minigame will become available when the Gold Saucer reopens on

There are 3 available courses; Beginner(A), Advanced(B), Crazy(C). Depending on
how well you perform, you receive a prize. Prizes can only be won once.

'-ê'-ê'-ê' Note: In the PC Version, AWFUL
 ê8and BAD are swapped.
Total Points Calculation:
-ê
The total amount of points is based on your time, technique and balloons you
grabbed during the course. Three different balloon types exist: Red = 1 point,
Blue = 3 points, Green = 5 points. You'll find that the more points a balloon is
worth, the more difficult it is to get.

Scoring Points &amp; Deductions:
-ê
You can score 30 points on Technique, 30 on Time, and 40 points on Balloon, for
a total of 100 points. If you bump into something, you get a deduction of a
point on Technique (sometimes when you bump into something twice, this only
counts as 1 point deduction). If you miss a balloon you'll miss out on points,
and the faster you complete the course, the better your score on Time is. For
every TWO seconds you are slower than the 'Course Time' you get ONE point
deduction. The 'Course Times' to get all 30 points are like this for the
courses:
 ê.-ê
.-ê
.-ê
.
 ê|Course A: |Course B: |Course C: |
 ê|01'30&quot;000 |01'45&quot;000 |02'00&quot;000 |
 ê'-ê
'-ê
'-ê
'
So for example, if you clock a time of 1'31&quot;999 on Course A you would get 30
points, since it hasn't been exactly 2 seconds delay yet. At 1'32&quot;000 you get
29 points, because you are 2 seconds slower than the 'Course Time'.


Time Attack:
-ê
Once you score a GOOD (70+) ranking on each course, you unlock the Time Attack
mode which you can then enter by grabbing the Yellow Balloon at the start of a
track. During Time Attack, extra options appear under the pause menu. You can
change the floor texture from snow to checkered, and you can choose how the Mog
Ghost looks like, a snowboarding or sleighing Mog.

When you score a GOOD Ranking (on Time Attack), a Silver Balloon is unlocked at
the start of the individual course which grants a Speed Up, allowing you to
break all records. Your Ghost will stay on file as long as you don't exit the
Snowboarding minigame.

It worth mentioning that the times for the 8 rankings on Time Attack vary for
different versions of the game:

Secret #1: Once you've attained a SUPER Ranking on Course A (on Time Attack)
-ê
 you'll unlock the Cactuar Ghost which you can select from options,
 êunder Ghost (the ? ? ? option, only available during Time Attack).
 êIt's basically a change from the Ghost Mog to a running Cactuar!

Secret #2: If you have Tifa or Cid in your party, There's a 37.5% chance they'll
-ê
 ask you if they can snowboard in Cloud's place! The game always
 êchecks Tifa first, so if both Tifa and Cid are in your party, Cid
 êwill never ask to ride the snowboard. Both Tifa and Cid were the
 êparty's leader at some point in the game, during which they could
 êaccess the Gold Saucer. Hence they're playable afterwards, too.


Japanese Version Differences:
-ê
Shademp informed me of various differences between the Original Japanese version
and the so called International Japanese version (a later release of the game
that featured a bonus disc with some extras).  Both versions are in Japanese.

Original Japanese Version:
-ê
- Has no ??? ghost.
- There is no option to switch between Snow/Checked surface.
- When toggling between the two record Ghosts (without picking one), the Ghost
  on the screen is not changing. You have to pick a ghost for it to change.
  In all later versions the Ghost changes in &quot;real-time&quot;.
- An incorrect Japanese symbol is used for getting 100 points on Course B.
  It is the symbol for the Freak rating in Time Attack, instead of the standard
  &quot;Cool&quot; rating in Balloon Mode.

International Japanese Version:
-ê
- There is now a new rank for getting 100 Points on Course C.  Its meaning is
  something along the lines of &quot;unattained even by freaks&quot;, while the other
  standard rank in the original means something more like &quot;unattained by people
  before you&quot;. In other words, the new rank emphasizes how difficult it is
  scoring 100 points on Course C.
- All general text and menu options are in English.  Only the rankings and the
  course symbols above the start of each stage are still in Japanese.

This minigame becomes available after the submarine chase during the main
storyline on Disc 2. You can choose from five levels that are increasingly
difficult. The goal is to destroy all enemy submarines. As you attempt harder
difficulties you'll find that enemy subs take more hits and that the levels
contain more mines.

It's easiest to use your sonar, locate any nearby enemy subs, get behind them
and fire your torpedoes all at once after locking on. See the table for the
levels, prizes and amount of targets. You can replay any level as many times as
you want and still get all five prizes. In other words, you could for example
replay Level 2 (a short level) five times without playing other levels and
still get all prizes.

  '-ê'-ê'-ê'
   Note: Prizes can only be won once.

The score you net doesn't influence the prize you get. The faster you beat a
level, the higher your score will be, and the less damage you take the more
points you get. Higher difficulties will initially net you more points than
lower difficulties.

Trivia: The English NTSC version incorrectly spells Cauldron as &quot;Caldron&quot;.

The Speed Square is a minigame on its own. It's essentially a rollercoaster with
a built-in laser gun to shoot targets during the course and acquire points.

It is highly recommended to play through the minigame several times and memorize
where all targets are located at before attempting to achieve a highscore (or
simply scoring above 5000+ points to get a good prize). Refer to the following

 Note: The Large Cactus is the one dropping down with a boulder. This is also
 êthe last Cactus target.

o The Yellow Boulder can be shot on two occasions. The first is when you're
  in the canyon, and this is often by pure luck. The boulder is located at the
  canyon top. The second occasion - still in the canyon - is when you are
  turning around and a single blue plane pops up. Just before that happens,
  check the very top of the canyon and shoot the boulder. We suggest shooting it
  during this second chance as you don't have any other targets to hit during
  that time.

o The red wheel of the boat appears after the yellow submarine targets. The
  longer you shoot this wheel, the more points you'll net. Hold  down your laser
  while keeping it aimed at the wheel until it fades off the screen, and the
  counter will keep rolling for a short while.

  Note: The red wheel could net you infinite points in the JP version of the
 êgame. This was fixed in all other versions, and it will only give you
 êa few hundred points at most.

o The zeppelin's propeller is a target apart. The elusive target may sound like
  a false rumor to many as it's NOT an actual target in several versions of the
  game. It *can* however be shot in the PC version of the game. It briefly
  appears twice and it can thus be shot at two short occasions, the first
  granting much more points than the second. The propeller can definitely NOT be
  shot in the PAL or NTCS Playstation versions of the game.

o The secret headlight is the 2nd last headlight that appears on the left side
  of the tracks before the coaster ends. You just have to try and find its
  location until you can consistently score the 200 extra points.
-êO

Depending on how good you do, prizes are handed out. You need 3000+ points to
receive a prize, but only 5000+ points will net you a useful prize. Check the
table below for the possible prizes:
  .-ê	.-ê?.
  |Points:  |Prizes: ê8|
  |-ê	|-ê?|
  |3000-4999|Masamune Blade (50%), Super Sweeper (25%), 1/35 Soldier (25%)  |
  |  5000+  |Umbrella (Disc 1), Flayer (Disc 2-3) [Both are given only ONCE]|
  '-ê	'-ê?'
  After receiving the prize for scoring 5000+ points you'll get the regular
  prizes again. The Flayer is given only after you receive the airship.

 ê|| ê{M1.3} Battle Square ê
||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-oO

The Battle Square is an arena in which you battle opponents for eight</span><span id="faqspan-10">
consecutive rounds. You are given the choice to quit after winning a round, but
it's not possible to stop during a battle itself. You are never actually killed
in the Battle Square. It's not possible to learn Enemy Skills from the Battle
Square either, and any Limit Breaks you use will be reset to their initial level
after all rounds. You *do* however lose any items you use, but you also get to
keep anything you steal or morph.

Every time you win a round, slots roll and you'll have to select a handicap out
of one to three slots. It is only during the 7th and 8th rounds that you'll
actually get decent amounts of points from the handicaps given, so we highly
recommend you to choose the least worse handicaps in the earlier rounds.

Please note that you will lose all your Battle Points (BP) as soon as you leave
the Battle Square. Spend whatever you've built up at the prize machines inside.
It's perhaps even more important to bring enough GP so you are able to fight
enough rounds to rack up BP for the better prizes.

Handicaps   |
-ê'

During the battle, you will get the opportunity to choose if you want to keep
fighting, or end the battle (which brings you back to the battle square with
most likely little battle points). If you continue, and you should if you want
to get some decent battle points, you will have to select an icon on a spinning
slot machine. This is called the handicap which you will get at the start of
the next battle. Since you agreed to continue, you'll have to live with it.
Depending on what the handicap is, and in which round you get it, you get BP.

 Note: 10 points are always given as a starting number.

As you can see, you're not getting a worthwhile amount of points up until the
7th and 8th battles. Therefore it's best to choose the least bad handicaps in
the battles 2-6 in order to have a higher chance getting to the 7th &amp; 8th
battles. A good way to choose what handicap you'll get is to manipulate the
spinning slot machine by tapping square quickly, which basically slows the slots
down. There are always three handicaps on a slot (sometimes it's 3 the same
though). If the slots are, for example, a Frog, 5 Lvl Down, and Green Materia,
and you want the 5 Lvl Down handicap, tap square like I described previously,
and press circle the moment the Frog picture passes the middle of the slot. It
will spin to the next icon and halt there.

Here's a table of what each handicap does:

  .-ê.-ê3.

Note: All characters can participate in the regular battles.

Note: If you talk to the lady at the base of the stairs near the exits to other

The enemies you face depend on several things. First of all, where you are in
the game, there are three points as listed below which affect which creatures
you can encounter. Then there's either the A or B group, which is determined at
the start when you enter. Per battle is then determined which creature group
you will face. The last group in the 8th battle is the same for A &amp; B.

NOTE: All creatures in the Battle Square Arena are stronger versions of their
normal selves. HP is doubled (200%), and Attack and Magic Attack are both 125%
compared to 100% being normal.

Strategies (after getting the buggy):
-ê%
o Most battles are rather easy, but there is at least one exception.
o The battle against five Capparwires in round 7 is famously difficult to win
  with only one character. They attack swiftly and ruthlessly, so you'll want
  to have enough MP available before moving on to round 7 to allow a casting
  of the enemy skill Beta. Additionally, take defensive measures near the end of
  battle 6 with a casting of Big Guard, or you won't stand a chance.
o It's a good idea to steal several 'Right Arm' items from Bombs on the long
  North Corel Bridge. These easily deal 1000 damage.
o Keep a healthy supply of Ethers to replenish your MP. You'll need plenty of
  them in the tougher battles to keep up with an endless casting of Beta,
  Aqualung, White Wind (and optionally Big Guard).

Strategies (after getting the Tiny Bronco):
-ê+
Winning the battle when Dio asks you to fight will net you a Protect Vest and
a Choco Feather, so it's worth your time to prepare for the fight:

o Purchase a Diamond Bangle from Bone Village and equip it.
o Put an Added Effect Materia linked to Destruct in your weapon.
  (Alternatively, pair Added Effect with a Time Materia in your weapon.)
  (Alternatively still, pair Added Effect a with Time Materia in your armor.
   This protects you against Slow and Stop, which proves especially helpful
   against those pesky Kimara Bugs.)
o Equip the accessory you like best, perhaps a stat-boosting one.
o Make sure you have several 'Right Arms'. These can be stolen from Bombs,
  found on the enormous bridge that leads to North Corel.
o Keep a healthy stash of Ethers in order to resupply your MP. It's important
  you can keep healing yourself with the enemy skill White Wind, and attack
  with the powerful Beta or Aqualung. These hit all targets and do massive
  damage at this point in the game.
o L4 Suicide works on various enemies, including Valrons.

Tip: After your visit to the Temple of the Ancients, equip the Ribbon accessory.

The special battle:
-ê

Cost: 10 GP
Prizes: - Final Attack Materia (first time, only ONCE)
 ê- Ribbon (after 10 wins)
 ê- Gambler, Masamune Blade, Combat Dairy, Autograph

Requirements to participate:
-ê
- *Learned* Omnislash (not just 'having' the Limit Break Manual).
- Have W-Summon.
- Have Ultima Weapon.
- Only Cloud can participate.

The opponents in the special battle are always the same. The second battle
features a unique opponent that was planned inside the Ancient Forest but was
left out: Ho-Chu. You can morph it into a Ribbon accessory, which is the easiest
way to obtain this accessory as Ho-Chu only has 8000 HP.

Tips &amp; Tricks:
-êP
This is a very brief summary of the tricks and hints discussed in this section.

1) The Slots Trick:
-ê
A good way to choose what handicap you'll get is to manipulate the spinning
slot machine by tapping square quickly, which basically slows the slots down.
There are always three handicaps on a slot (sometimes it's 3 the same though).
If the slots are, for example, a Frog, 5 Lvl Down, and Green Materia, and you
want the 5 Lvl Down handicap, tap square like I described previously, and press
circle the moment the Frog picture passes the middle of the slot. It will spin
to the next icon and halt there, because it takes a bit to press the button and
for the game to confirm. Don't forget, practice makes perfect.

2) The Escape Trick:
-ê
If things get really rough, you CAN use a Smoke Bomb item to escape, and STILL
receive all the BP, including the handicap for that battle! Same thing works
for the Exit Materia.

{M1.4} Chocobo Square ê
||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-oO

After having caught a Chocobo (and fed it several greens) you can go attempt
the Chocobo Races (Disc 2, after Gold Saucer re-opens). On Disc 1 you can only
bet on chocobo's, and only from the C &amp; B Classes (with not too good items).

In every individual race, three items are randomly selected. The better the
item is, the rarer it is, and the less it appears on the squares.. The common
item has 7 out of the 15 squares (~46.6%), the uncommon item 5 out of 15
squares (~33.3%), and the rare item only 3 out of 15 (20%). In the S-Class,
items of 300+ GP are always rare.

These are the prize lists for the chocobo races. When you win an item, you can
either take the item or exchange it for GP. The GP values are listed behind the
won item:

Different jockeys:
-ê
If Tifa or Cid is in your party, there's a 50% chance they'll ask if they can
ride the race instead of Cloud. This does not affect the race in any way
whatsoever, statistic wise. If both Tifa and Cid are in your party, Tifa will
always ask if she can ride Cloud's Chocobo, and poor old Cid is never given the
chance to do so.

Long/Short Course:
-ê
You can choose between the Long &amp; Short Course. I suggest going for the Short
Course, because there's NO difference in prize, and the Long Course just takes
longer to complete.

Colored Chocobos:
-ê
Green chocobos have the advantage of running with regular speed (instead of
slowed speed) through the Space section at the end of the Short Course. Possibly
due to sloppy programming, blue chocobos don't have any advantage on the tracks
(at least in the PS version), and won't run unaffected through the water section
in the Long Course. Black &amp; Gold chocobo's run unaffected through both. Yellow
(normal) chocobo's are slowed down by both parts (normal are also all other
colored racers, but obviously not Joe/TEIOH).

Joe &amp; TEIOH:
-ê
Joe is the name of a unique jockey with a hat, TEIOH is his black chocobo. He's
always a decent challenge due to his black chocobo's ability to run though all
the obstacles like normal. But that's not all, because his chocobo will ALWAYS
have stats based on your chocobo. His speed will always be +10% higher than
yours, and his stamina will always be +25% higher than yours. This always make
him the better racer, statistically speaking. There is, however, a surefire way
to defeat Joe time after time.

Start off and speed up your (black or gold) chocobo with square, and refill
your stamina with R1+R2. You should stay ahead of Joe for a long period, and
when your stamina is starting to run out (at 1/6th or less or so), you should
already be near the end, so dash for it with circle. If your stamina runs out
faster than expected, hit X a few times to slow down slightly. Be sure to have
a tiny bit of stamina left for the last part.

Impressing Esther:
-ê
If you win 10 times in a row on the S-rank class, Esther will be impressed and
give you the following set of prizes ONCE:

Sprint Shoes, Precious Watch, Cat's Bell, Chocobracelet, Counter Attack Materia.

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO



The Round Square is where the Gondola is. This is the second part of the famous
date scenes, but it's also possible to take any character on the Gondola by
just getting on during the late Disc2/3 for 10 GP. You'll get to see a couple
of FMV's you've not seen before, including a close up to the Golden Dio.

The Event Square is where the first part of the date scene happens. There is
NOTHING else here, which is somewhat disappointing.

Ghost Square is basically an Inn, but it also holds the 3rd Turtle Paradise
Flyer, and a shop that sells crappy items. In Cloud's room, after getting the
Keystone, you can grab a hidden Elixir from the cabinet. That's everything
there though.

The Station Square is where you can go back with the Ropeway to North Corel and
the World Map. However, there is also a secret GP-dude who sells GP for gil. He
appears ONLY AFTER GETTING THE HIGHWIND, and you have about 15% chance of
seeing him, or in other words every 1 out of 7 times or so. You can just walk
in the Gold Saucer and out to see if he's there. Where exactly is he hiding?
He's north from the save point, hiding a bit behind the house. A screenshot can
be found here (thanks to shadow666):
http://www.shillatime.org/gpdude.jpg

The GP-Dude sells 1 GP for 100 gil, up to a max of 100 GP for 10ê gil. Fair
enough. This is the max GP each time you see him; Then he will vanish from the
screen. You will need to walk in and out again to make him re-appear. This can
be done infinitely.

The Gold Saucer Date can be done with Aeris, Tifa, Yuffie, and also Barret.

The dating scenes can be watched here. I did not record these video's myself,
all credits go out to the recorder:

Aeris:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6fvjZrYYwU
Tifa:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skm5p3r-JcA
Yuffie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1MO-R5mPC0
Barret: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D30JDkDHWZk

The Date Mechanics are actually quite simple, but that's only due to Terence,
who has established the mechanics behind the date scene a long time ago.

All you have to do is pay attention during the storyline, and make the correct
choices for your character, so that the one you want to date, gets the most
affection points.

Affection values start like this:

Aeris:  50
Tifa:   30
Yuffie: 10
Barret:  0

If characters tie in value, the priority is as follows: Aeris, Tifa, Yuffie, 
and lastly Barret.

SHORT RESULT SUMMARY:
-ê
- To get Aeris, simply be very nice towards her during the entire game, and be
  mean to all other characters.  Since Aeris is the easiest character to date,
  this shouldn't be a problem at all.

- To date Tifa, be unkind to Aeris, Yuffie and Barret. When imprisoned in the
  Shinra Building, early disc 1, repeatedly tell Tifa &quot;Leave it to me!&quot; when
  she asks if they can get out. This increases her affection value +1 every
  time you do this, so be sure to do it a lot of times to be safe. 60+ should
  be on the safe side.

- To date Yuffie, be unkind to the others and repeatedly attempt to get Yuffie
  when encountered for the first time.  Always ask for her name, which prevents
  her from joining the party, but allowing you to get the affection points from
  the dialogue once again. This way you gain +8 affection points for every
  repeat. Doing this five times should be more than enough as long as you're
  unfriendly towards especially Aeris (and Tifa).

- To date Barret, again be unkind to especially Aeris and Tifa, and friendly
  with Barret.  Before entering Cosmo Canyon for the first time, put him into
  your party.  Then find Barret in the room behind Tiger Lily's weapon shop and
  tell him &quot;Go on&quot;, followed by &quot;Yeah, whatever...&quot; and exit/re-enter the room.
  The &quot;Go on&quot; option grants you +3 affection points, so repeating this
  procedure will quickly guarantee that Barret has the highest value of all
  party members. Repeat it 25 times to be on the safe side.


Now for the in-depth dialogue mechanics:


Midgar
-ê
Talking to Aeris the first time, no matter what you say (believe it or not),
has no effect. Buy the flower, unless you want to date Aeris or Yuffie.

Talk to Jessie twice on the train home from the first mission:
 ê&quot;Thanks anyway&quot; ê	--
 ê&quot;Looking forward to it&quot; (-3 Tifa)

When you enter Seventh Heaven, and you have a flower:
 ê&quot;Give it to Tifa&quot; ê(+5 Tifa)
 ê&quot;Give it to Marlene&quot; (+5 Barret)

If you talk to Tifa while she's behind the bar:
 ê&quot;I don't feel like it&quot;   --
 ê&quot;Give me something hard&quot; (+5 Tifa)

When Tifa accuses you of leaving your childhood friend:
 ê&quot;How can you say that!&quot; (+5 Tifa)
 ê&quot;...Sorry&quot; ê--

When Tifa asks how you slept:
 ê&quot;Next to you, who wouldn't?&quot; ê(+5 Tifa)
 ê&quot;Barret's snoring kept me up...&quot; (+5 Barret)

Giving Barret a Materia tutorial has no effect.

Getting to the last car of the train without getting
caught by the Security Lockdown: (+5 Tifa, +5 Barret)

When Barret asks if you're alright:
 ê&quot;(Be strong)&quot; ê(+2 Barret)
 ê&quot;(I don't know if I can hold on)&quot; (-3 Barret, +1 Tifa)

Barret again to resume it at that point.  Also, if you leave the room after
picking &quot;Yeah, whatever...&quot;, you can return immediately to start the

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=oO

At any time after getting the Highwind, you can start breeding chocobo's. This
is easiest when the Gold Saucer re-opens, so you can also race with them.

Make sure you've got some money you can spend. You can sell some mastered
materia (All Materia sells for 1.4 Million Gold), or use the W-Item materia
trick to duplicate and sell items. You could also train on the beach of Mideel
and get up to 10k gold with the Gil-plus materia.

Talk to Choco Bill and rent 6 stables (just rent them all to make things easy).
Also grab the Chocobo Lure Materia from the lower right near the fence. You
should also have bought one on disc 1 before the Midgar Zolom though..make sure
to equip it one someone.

First of all, you'll need to catch a Chocobo. There are many places you can
catch Chocobo's, but there are only three places of interest for us, if we want
to breed to colored Chocobo's. These places are like this:

Gold Saucer Area: You can catch a Good Chocobo here (Appears with 2 Spencers)
Mideel Area: You can catch a Great Chocobo here (Appears with 1 or 2 Spirals)
Icicle Area: You can catch a Wonderful Chocobo here
(Appears with 1 or 2 Jumpings)

The chance you'll get the right encounter for a Good Chocobo when you get into
a Chocobo battle at the Gold Saucer area, is about 15.7%.

The chance you'll get the right encounter for a Great Chocobo when you get into
a Chocobo battle at the Mideel area, is about 43.9%.

The chance you'll get the right encounter for a Wonderful Chocobo when you get
into a Chocobo battle at the Icicle area, is about 19.5%.

Press the Select button to see which enemies come along with it if you don't
recognize the names of the enemies it's supposed to appear with. Also buy
yourself a bunch of Reagan Greens (at the Chocobo Sage). The Chocobo Sage lives
in the house surrounded by mountains east of Icicle Inn, and nearby the cave
exit of the Coral Valley Cave. Reagan Greens have the special property when
used in battle on a Chocobo, that the Chocobo is kept busy for several turns,
and it also heavily reduces the chance that the Chocobo will run away. Of
course, that still doesn't mean you can attack the Chocobo! It means you can
kill the other enemies without trouble scaring the Chocobo away.

Now catch a great male/female, and a good male/female. Dismount and send them
to your stables. You'll now need some nuts to breed the chocobo's. You need to
get 3 Carob Nuts, you can steal these from Vlakorados (looks like a dinosaur)</span><span id="faqspan-11">
which appears on the grass area near Bone Village. It's got a lot of HP (3ê).
You also need a Zeio Nut. This can be stolen from Goblins, on Goblin Island.
This is located northeast of the eastern(midgar) continent. Goblins appear in
the forests.

Now buy a bunch of Sylkis Greens from the Chocobo Sage and feed your chocobo's
these greens. The more the better. Now start racing with all four chocobo's,
and make sure they ALL have at LEAST won 2 times in the chocobo races.

Using the Carob Nuts to breed:
Breed the Good Male with the Great Female, and breed the Great Male with the
Good Female. Before you do this, save your game. You should get a Green and a
Blue Chocobo of opposite genders, so reset the game if it's not the opposite
gender. Note: if it stays the same gender each time even after resetting, go
fly around in the Highwind, enter and exit some towns, then save your game
again, and try again a couple of times.

After getting the Green and Blue Chocobo's, feed them a bunch of Sylkis Greens
to up their stats, and race them until they have a minimum of 9 combined wins,
simply said. After this, fight between 3 - 18 battles (this is so that newborn
chocobo's can breed again), and save your game. Breed them with the Carob Nut
and you will get a Black Chocobo.

Now go catch a Wonderful Chocobo of the opposite sex of the Black, which can be
caught near Icicle Inn (appears with 1 or 2 Jumpings). Now feed them some
Sylkis Greens again, and race them until they have a minimum of 12 wins
combined. Fight between 3 - 18 battles again so you can mate the chocobo's, and
use the Zeio Nut. You will get a Gold Chocobo. Be SURE to select the Black
Chocobo as the first Chocobo; Due to a bug you cannot get a Gold Chocobo if you
select the Wonderful Chocobo first.

Catching Chocobos:
=ê
When attempting to catch a Chocobo, you should know that it matters which
enemies accompany the Chocobo in the battle. The Chocobo's Level means nothing
to the rating. The rating is solely based on the battle, and which enemies
accompany the Chocobo.

You can only catch Chocobo's on the World Map at Chocobo Tracks, and you MUST
have a Chocobo Lure Materia equipped. A Level 1 Chocobo Lure Materia gives a
'Lure Rating' of 8. L2 gives a rating of 12, and a L3&amp;L4 give a rating of 16.
The maximum rating you can get by stacking Chocobo Lure materia is 32. You can
get this with two L3 or higher Chocobo Lure Materia. With a rating of 32, you
will get 100% Chocobo encounters on Chocobo Tracks. To compare, a rating of 16
would give you 100% around the Chocobo Ranch &amp; Junon, and only 50% everywhere
else. A rating of only 8 would give you 75% around the Ranch, 50% around Junon,
and only 25% everywhere else.

A table can help illustrate this further:
.-ê.-ê.-ê.-ê.-ê.
|Chocobo Lure |Rating:|Chance Chocobo |Chance Chocobo |Chance Chocobo ê	|
|Materia Lvl: | ê|battle Ranch:  |battle Junon:  |battle everywhere else:|
|-ê|-ê|-ê|-ê|-ê|

|2x Lvl 3 or 4|  32   | ê100% ê| ê100% ê| ê100% ê|
'-ê'-ê'-ê'-ê'-ê'

You can use Greens to keep the Chocobo busy for several turns, and to reduce
the chance that it runs away due to being scared. The default chance that a
Chocobo will run away is 50%. Here's what the Greens will do:

Gyshal Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 2 turns.
Krakka Greens:  Reduces the Chocobo's chance to run to 33.3%.
Tantal Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 3 turns.
Pahsana Greens: Reduces the Chocobo's chance to run to 20%.
Curiel Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 5 turns.
Mimett Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo busy for 1 turn, and allows use of Chocobuckle.
Reagan Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo busy for 8 turns and reduces the Chocobo's
 êchance to run to 12.5%.
Sylkis Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 1 turn, and allows use of
 êChocobuckle.

In other words, Reagan Greens are the best Greens for catching Chocobos. You
might as well use Curiel Greens, which will occupy the Chocobo for 5 turns.

When you've caught a Chocobo, the gender isn't directly assigned to the
Chocobo. This will happen when you move the Chocobo from the outside fence to
the stables inside. You can save your game before you do this and reload until
you get the desired result.

When you've caught and/or fed a Chocobo and you're viewing them, you can press
the L1 and R1 buttons to rotate the chocobo. Just a little nifty thing.


The Stats:
=ê
Every Chocobo has several stats, some visible to the player, most invisible.
This makes it difficult to tell how high most stats are. There are, fortunately
some ways to uncover how high certain stats are. Some stats are more easily
maxed out than others, and when maxed you will know the stat's number.

Dash: êThe Chocobo's current sprinting speed (when holding circle)
 ê(Max = MDash)
MDash: êThe maximum Dash that the Chocobo will ever get (Max MDash = 6000)
Run: êThe Chocobo's normal running speed (Max = MRun = 6000)
MRun: êThe maximum Run that the Chocobo will ever get (Max = 6000)
-ê
Stam: êThe Chocobo's (technical) Stamina. (Max = 9ê)
Accel: êThe Chocobo's Acceleration (Max = 100)
Co-Op: êThe Chocobo's Co-operation (how well it obeys Manual Control)
 ê(Max = 100)
Int: êThe Chocobo's Intelligence (how well it races on Auto Control)
 ê(Max = 100)
-ê
Races Won: The amount of races a Chocobo has won
Gender: êThe Chocobo's gender, either male/female
Color: êThe Chocobo's Color, either Yellow/Green/Blue/Black/Gold
Rating: êThe Chocobo's rating, from Wonderful to Terrible

The Stats you can see:
-ê
Speed   = [Dash/34] (Max = 6000/34 = 176)
Stamina = [Stam/10] (Max = 9ê/10 = 999)

thus..

Dash ê= approx..[34*Speed] (Max = 6000)

When fresh caught, you can get one out of 8 types of Chocobo's. The stats the
Chocobo will have vary greatly depending on what type you've caught. Below is
a chart with the ranges in which the types vary in their stats. Only the most
important stats are listed in the table:

MSpeed is the range of the max speed the caught Chocobo will/can ever attain.
Speed is the range of the current speed the caught Chocobo will/can have.

 ê-ê

For example, it's possible that your Chocobo is a Great type, and it can have
a minimum of 85 MSpeed. In this case, the Chocobo will NEVER be able to get
higher speed than that. It's very likely the Chocobo comes with a rather low
current speed as well (with 42 being the lowest).

Usually, due to the mechanics behind all this, Chocobo's will get stats around
the middle of the stat ranges presented in the table. You can make fairly good
Chocobo's out of caught Chocobos, but they can never reach the highest of stats
because that always requires breeding. Feeding them with Greens still helps a
lot. Speaking of Greens, that's the next section:


Feeding Greens/Raising Stats:
=ê
Each Green has unique properties to raise a Chocobo's stats. Each Green only
raises a specific combination of stats, which requires you to feed several
different Greens to Chocobo's.

Gysahl Greens:
-ê
Dash  + [0-3] (Legend: Somewhere between 0 and 3, only round numbers)
Run   + [0-2]
Stam  + [0-3]
Co-Op +  [1]

Krakka Greens:
-ê
Int   + [1-2]
Co-Op +  [1]

Tantal Greens:
-ê
Dash  + [1-4]
Run   + [1-4]
Stam  + [1-2]
Int   +  [1]
Co-Op +  [1]

Pahsana Greens:
-ê
Int   + [1-8]
Co-Op + 25%[1], 75%[2] ê(25% chance the increase is 1, 75% chance the
 êincrease is 2 points)

Curiel Greens:
-ê
Dash  + [0-3]
Run   + [0-3]
Stam  + [3-10]
Co-Op +  [2]

Mimett Greens:
-ê
Dash  + [1-16]
Run   + [0-3]
Stam  + [3-10]
Accel + 75%[0], 25%[1]
Co-Op + [2]

Reagan Greens:
-ê
Dash = [Speed * 34]

x = [Dash/20], y = [between 0 &amp; 10]
Dash  + 50%[x+y], 50%[x-y], minimum = 0

x = [Run/20], y = [between 0 &amp; 10]
Run   + 50%[x+y], 50%[x-y], minimum = 0

x = [Stam/100], y = [between 0 &amp; 10]
Stam  + 50%[x+y], 50%[x-y], minimum = 0

Co-Op + [3]

Sylkis Greens:
-ê
Dash = [Speed * 34]

x = [Dash/10], y = [between 0 &amp; 10]
Dash  + 50%[x+y], 50%[x-y], minimum = 0

x = [Run/10], y = [between 0 &amp; 10]
Run   + 50%[x+y], 50%[x-y], minimum = 0

x = [Stam/50], y = [between 0 &amp; 10]
Stam  + 50%[x+y], 50%[x-y], minimum = 0

Int   + [1-4]
Co-Op +  [4]


If you look closely, you'll see that Sylkis Greens are 2 times better than
Reagan Greens. Sylkis Greens are also the best Greens to raise Dash, Run, Stam,
and Co-Op with. Pahsana are the best to raise Int. The only Greens that cause
an increase in Accel are Mimett Greens, and there's only a 25% chance for an
increase. Then again, most Chocobo's will only need about 30 points increase
for Accel.

Feeding the Chocobo with tons of Greens can certainly improve the Chocobo's
stats, but only to the maximum of the Chocobo's potential (MRun, MDash, and 999
for Stamina, and 100 for Accel, Int, Co-Op). You can only attain higher MRun
and MDash on your Chocobo's by breeding Chocobo's. Lucky you, as that's what
the next section covers:


Breeding Chocobo's/The Nuts:
=ê
Many of the Nuts are actually utterly useless. Pepio Nut actually makes your
Chocobo worse than it's parents.. Luchile Nut cannot increase the Chocobo stats
either. Saraha, Lasan, Pram, and Porov Nut can increase your Chocobo's stats,
but the chances are small, and the increase is much better with some other
Nuts. Plus the afore mentioned Nuts also have a chance to decrease your born
Chocobo's stats to below the parent's average.

In short, you're NUTS if you use any of the above Nuts. ^_^&quot;

The Carob Nut is essential to breed your first Blue and Green Chocobo's. If you
are just interested in breeding the ultimate breed however, you'll just want
to use Zeio Nuts, which are the best Nuts in the game when it comes to stats.
Therefore, this is the only Nut I will present the stats for. Really, don't
worry about the other crap.

When the game says a Chocobo isn't ready to breed again, then simply waiting
doesn't do the trick. You must fight some battles before they can breed again:

Note: Mating Chocobo's always gives 50% chance on either gender.
-ê Newborn Chocobo: Can breed after 3 to 18 battles.
 êParent Chocobo: Can breed again after 3 to 10 battles.

Zeio Nut:
-ê	
Max Dash =  55/256 chance -&gt; Baby's MDash set to highest of Parent's MDash, and
 êincreased by 1/10th. Max MDash is 6000.
 ê201/256 chance -&gt; Baby's MDash set to average of Parent's MDash.

Dash ê=  Average of Parent's Dash.

Max Run  =  80/256 chance -&gt; Baby's MRun set to highest of Parent's MRun, and
 êincreased by 1/8th. Max MRun is 6000.

Note: If you get a Gold Chocobo out of the breeding, and it would normally be

 ê"| 1/16 chance -&gt; MDash = 5950(!)
 êThese numbers will get increased/decreased by a number between 0 and 25.

 êFort Condor Treasure Chart:
 ê=ê

Note: It's best to NOT SKIP ANY battle. It's hard to explain which prize you
will get if you forget to do battles. Besides, the only reason to go through
all this effort is because you want a Perfect Treasure File.. right? Most of
the time though, when you miss a battle and you do the next one, you'll get the
prize of the last battle.

If you let the enemies reach the shack, you'll have to fight CMD. Grand Horn.
During battles #1-3, he will drop a Vagyrisk Claw. During the other battles,
you'll face a higher leveled CMD. Grand Horn, UNLESS your party level is very
low (19 &amp; below) and you're only 5 enemies away from beating the battle. If
you have to fight CMD. Grand Horn, you will NOT receive any battle prize!

The mandatory (L37) CMD. Grand Horn always drops the Imperial Guard, and is
only fought during the Huge Materia Battle. This is the only exception when it
comes to battle prizes: You'll also receive the Phoenix and Huge Materia. If
you fail to lose to this 'boss', you will never be able to enter Fort Condor
again, instead of getting Game Over.

Battles #14-18 are considered won if you had given them at least 15000 gold,
that is 3000 for each battle. You will never get any prizes for them, however.
The following chart is completely correct and tested by myself twice. If you do
all battles nothing can go wrong. The chart works (best) if you do all battles.

 êFort Condor Troops and Enemies:
 ê=ê

As for funding, I guess this is the place to put this. If you want to let them
handle it, they need to have 3000 gil at the very least. If you have too little
money on you yourself (less than 4000), the man will not allow you to do the
battle either. On another interesting note: The max amount of gil you can give
them is 32767 gil. You can do this by giving them 500 gil until you're at like
29500 and then giving them a large amount of money. This does nothing other than
having theoretically maxed out their funding and you feeling a good boy/girl.

The maximum amount of troops you can have during a battle is 20.

 êFort Condor Battle Formations:
 ê=ê

Enemies can come from either the left or the right. If, at any time, you've
defeated all enemies on the screen, meaning there are no enemies left to fight,
you will have won the battle, and any further enemies will not appear.

Trick: To easily win a battle, place one Fighter and start the fight. You can
now place another Fighter, except lower than the first. Go as low as possible,
you'll see a red laser line that indicates where you may still place your
troops (your territory, basically). Repeat this until you got some Fighters
near the enemies. Quickly assault these enemies and guard the entrances they
come through. When the enemies are defeated, and thus no enemies are on screen,
you'll have won the battle. You can speed this up by R1 or R2 for faster battle
speed.

The charts below show the battle formations.

There are quite some treasures that can be dug up in Bone Village. But there
are also many rumored items, most of which are false and cannot be dug up. This
section will hopefully clear up most of it.

Trick:
-ê
First of all, you should know that you don't NEED to place men to help you
located the digging spot(s), if you already KNOW where the spots are located!
Since this guide lists the locations of all 'hotspots', it is no longer
necessary to place diggers, thus allowing you to dig up treasures for free!

The first time you can access Bone Village is after getting the Tiny Bronco.
The first time you can dig up treasure in Bone Village is after finishing the
Temple of the Ancients, hence, to continue, you need to dig up the Lunar Harp.

Since an image says a thousand words (and it sort of does, actually), here is
the Treasure Map of Bone Village:

 ê-ê"
 êwww.shillatime.org/bonevillage.jpg
 ê-ê"

Information about items, spots and their chances are all on the image. And as
you can also read on there, it's possible to dig for free by just not placing
any diggers! The map shows the spots already. This also means you can get
infinite free Ethers (100% chance) and Elixirs (14.06% chance) at spots 6 and 5
respectively.

Note: It's unknown where Catastrophe and Steal Materia can be dug up, but it's
supposedly be able to be dug up at least in the Playstation Version. This
remains a rumor for now, however. If you can confirm you've found either of them
(or if you've done lengthy research but didn't find them), please send me an
email. It is probably not possible to dig up the Steal Materia in the PC
version.

For perfect treasure gamers, it may be useful to note that one has to dig up
the Megalixir, the Mop, and the Buntline. The Key to Sector 5 is obviously also
required.

 ê{M5.1} Gym Squats in Wall Market
 ê=ê 
You're battling a guy on steroids for a Wig. The controls are: [], X, O.êin
that order, and repeat to perform squats. Only press the next button the moment
Cloud has stopped moving, because if he's still in movement, he'll scratch his
head like a dumb-ass which costs you precious time. I suggest you save before
attempting this, as it's quite possible to lose. As for the guy on steroids
(who is not Big Bro, btw, that is the gym-owner who gives you a wig), he will
perform squats ranging from about .. 12 - 19. His average is around 15 - 17.
The record for this game is likely to be 21 squats. Mail me your best!


 ê{M5.2}  Mayor Domino's Password
 ê=ê
On the 62nd floor of the Shinra Building, you must do a little puzzle to guess
the password of Mayor Domino correctly. Even if you try out all passwords, he
still gives away his Keycard 65, but if you want to get an additional prize,
you must guess the password correctly. The password is NEVER: ORBS or HOJO.

You can pay Hart 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and even 15000 gil for hints, but I
urge you not to, as he won't say anything that isn't already written here.
There are three methods of getting the password. The first involves you
puzzling it out on your own, with tables to help you on your way. The second
and third methods are tricks to get the password quickly. If you pay Hart all
the way up to 15000 gil (who the hell has 23500 gil at this point of the game
anyway?), he'll just say you're dumb and give you his Keycard.

Here are the 3 Methods for getting the Password.

Method 1: The Honest method
-ê
There are 4 different sections of the library. The lower left is the 'Urban
Dev. Research Library'. In this section, the following files are the ones that
this section normally has to have:
 ê.-ê+.
 ê|Names of the files: ê|
 ê|-ê+|
 ê|Midgar City map: Sectors 5-8 ê|

 ê|Midgar City Map: Sectors 0-4 ê|
 ê'-ê+'

The lower right section is the 'Scientific Research Library', and the following
files are the ones that the section should normally have:
 ê.-ê0.
 ê|Names of the files: ê|
 ê|-ê0|
 ê|Final evolutionary stages in land dwelling life |
 ê|Report on high Mako levels in living beings ê|

 ê|Mako energy and the rise in life forms ê
|
 ê|File on Dr. Gast, Biologist ê|
 ê|Data on experimental animals living near Midgar |
 ê'-ê0'

The upper left section is the 'Peace Preservation/Weapon Dev. Research Library'
and the following files are the ones that the section should normally have:
 ê.-ê).
 ê|Names of the files: ê|
 ê|-ê)|
 ê|Materia production and its military uses |
 ê|Heidegger's Shinra peace keeping law ê|
 ê|Breakdown of SOLDIER members by class ê|
 ê|Plan for new land weapons ê|
 ê|Economic report: anti-Shinra activities  |
 ê|Ranks and extended use of Mako weaponry  |
 ê'-ê)'

Last, the upper right section is the 'Space Dev. Research Library' and the
following files are the ones that the section should normally have:
 ê.-ê/.
 ê|Names of the files: ê|
 ê|-ê/|
 ê|Modern history of Midgar space program vol. 1  |
 ê|Modern history of Midgar space program vol. 2  |
 ê|Diminishing Mako energy and Planet movements   |
 ê|Results of the failed space mission &quot;YA-79&quot; ê|
 ê|Economic report: Space Dev Program ê|
 ê|Shinra rocket space travel ê|
 ê'-ê/'

You'll notice that there is one file in each section that doesn't belong there.
You can simply check the above tables to see if something doesn't belong in a
section. That file, that doesn't belong in the section, has a number in front
of it, which you must check. This number indicates which letter of the file is
used in the password. For example, with the file 'Shinra rocket space travel'
with the number 15, the letter A is used in the password. Spaces don't count,
just letters/characters. Check all four the sections, and you'll get four
letters. These letters should form one of the words the Mayor lets you pick out
of: BEST, KING, ORBS, BOMB, MAKO, HOJO. The answer is NEVER: ORBS or HOJO.

Method 2: The quickest method
-ê
This one's easy, and comes from BrutalAl. Walk to the UPPER RIGHT ROOM, also
known as the 'Space Dev. Research Library', which has a blue floor and green
shelves. Check out the file on the LEFT of the MIDDLE shelf.

 ê.-ê=.
 ê|If the file is this: ê|Then password is: |
 ê|-ê*|-ê|
 ê|2 Economic report: Space Dev Program ê| êBEST ê|
 ê|1 Results of failed space mission &quot;YA-79&quot; | êKING ê|
 ê|1 Breakdown of SOLDIER members by class   | êBOMB ê|
 ê|10 New plans for urban planning ê| êMAKO ê|
 ê'-ê='

Method 3: Another alternative
-ê
There is also an easy trick that will also allow you to skip this whole puzzle.
Basically, talk to the Mayor, and when he asks you to choose a password, choose
'Wait a second'. Now take the elevator on the bottom of this screen to the
first floor. Head outside, and save the game. Go back up with the same
elevator, to the 62nd floor again. Try all the passwords until you got the
right one. Now reset the game, restart from your save, and go back up to the
Mayor and answer with the password you got from the previous time. Voila, the
Elemental Materia is yours!

The Prizes:
Your reward varies on how good you do:

 ê {M5.3} G-Bike
 ê =ê
This is the bike game you play when escaping from Shinra Building. You're
supposed to protect the car from the bikers, because when they hit the car,
they actually cause HP damage to your characters, and after the bike game you
will be attacked by Motor Ball, a boss. So you may want to keep your HP up.
Fortunately this is done rather easily. There are two kind of bikers: Orange
and Red ones. The bikers differ in AI, and the orange bikers tend to attack the
car directly, while the red bikers are meant to lure you away and maneuver
around you to get to the car (or let others get to it). If you keep slashing
with your sword (Square for left, O for right), never kill a red biker, and
stay close to the car, the red bikers will stay away from you and the car. This
strategy was made up by BrutalAl.


 ê{M5.4}  Tifa's Piano
 ê=ê
In the flashback Cloud gets the first opportunity to play the Piano in Tifa's
room.

When you get to Nibelheim the first time for real, you can play Tifa's Piano
again. The following sequence is the tune:

X, [], Triangle, R1+Triangle, R1+[], X, [], Triangle, R1+X, O, X, [], X.

If you play this sequence three times you'll get 1 gil from the Piano; Tifa's
secret savings.

When you're in control of Tifa as the team's leader, head back to Nibelheim and
inspect the Piano. You'll receive the Elemental Materia, but ONLY if you chose
to play the piano during the flashback and you said you 'jammed on it'.

And lastly, as most people know, after you've got Cloud back, head back to
Nibelheim, with Tifa in your party, and play the tune again. You'll get Tifa's
Final Limit Break, Final Heaven, and a letter from Zangan, her teacher.


 ê{M5.5} CPR on Priscilla
 ê=ê
This is done after the fight with Bottomswell. Basically, you can't go wrong
here, and there are no prizes. Still, it may be informative to know that you
need to breathe into her 41 times. Cloud will breathe a little bit every time,
but the max he can hold is 9 (or 10, but it may be tricky to breath into her).
If his lungs fill up too much, the gauge is reset. My thanks go to GarlandG, as
that's where I read this info for the first time.


 ê{M5.6} Jumping with Mr. Dolphin
 ê=ê
This is also a no-prize game. Basically, if you don't move at all, and press
[] twice, Cloud will be launched up the right spot. No need to do it any
different. You can also call Mr. Dolphin when you drive into Junon with the
Buggy: Mr. Dolphin will bring you to the other continent instantly!


 ê{M5.7} Parading
 ê=ê
You must run &quot;through&quot; the soldiers, instead of doing like the other soldier who
showed how to do it (if you do it that way, your score is likely going to suck).
In other words, hold X and the direction down button when you get to control
Cloud and he will run straight into the open spot. Now let go of the X button
and hold the direction left button and Cloud will start marching. The commander
will then tell you when to press circle (everytime he says &quot;Now&quot;). Don't press
circle until after the first message fully appears. After that, press circle
exactly at the end of each message.

Tip: It greatly helps if you set the message dialog speed to default.

Note: You *must* have the controls set to default in order to make this work.

 ê!The Prizes:
 ê&lt;29% (?) = Grenade
 ê30%-39% = 6 Potions
 ê40%-49% = 6 Ethers
 ê50%+ = 5000 gil


 ê{M5.8} The Send-off for Rufus
 ê=ê
This is the minigame where you do poses and such for Rufus (and Heidegger).
Simply press the right button when the commander tells you to. You get 10
points for each right move, except turning. You must face the same way as the
others to receive points, so turning is still important. Your victory pose will
get you 30 points. There is no fixed maximum you can get, since the commands
are random, and the more turns, the less max points you can get. Here are the
prizes you can get:

0-50 Points = Silver Glasses
60-90 Points = HP Plus Materia
100+ Points = Force Stealer

You can make Cloud move after the sendoff is already done by pressing the
buttons. He'll do things like scratch his back with his gun, shrug, or touch
his hip with his hands and pose.


 ê{M5.9} Snowboarding at Icicle Valley
		 ê=ê$
Very similar to Snowboarding in the Gold Saucer, but there are no rankings
whatsoever for this. I'll include a brief description for the tracks:
The first part (before any intersections) is the only part that holds balloons.
It starts out pretty easy with 12 red balloons. After a while a big jump is
coming up with a red, blue and a green balloon to get. After that, 2 red,
1 blue, 1 red, and 1 green balloon are on your path. The next part holds 6 red,
6 blue, 2 red, 2 green, 4 blue, 4 green balloons. In the tree section 5 red
balloons can be found. After that, 1 more red and 1 more blue are all that's
left to collect. It's IMPOSSIBLE to collect all the green/blue balloons
however.

After choosing at an intersection, here's what the course looks like:
Left: Small rocks in the snow, after which snowballs come rolling side to side.
Left/Left: Many penguins to dodge at first, after which you get many sharp
corners similar to the Course C in the Gold Saucer.
Left/Right: A red cave with many stalactites falling from the ceiling.
Right: You're snowboarding on ice with large gray rocks sticking out, and
snowballs rolling from the sides.
Right/Left: Some caves with crystals sticking out.
Right/Right: Mogs run from left to right and after that you'll have to dodge
igloos and the Mogs popping up from behind them.

Note: Anyone happen to know what the Yellow Balloons are for when I choose
Right, and then Left? In the Gold Saucer it's for time attack..


 ê{M5.10} Submarine battle
 ê=ê
There are 7 targets, but all that really matters is that you shoot down the red
submarine. You can do this pretty much at the start already, by popping a bunch
of torpedoes in it.

Controls:
Up ê	= Descend
Down ê= Ascend
Left/Right = Left or right
[] ê	= Launch Torpedo
X ê
= Decrease Speed
Triangle   = Increase Speed
R1 ê	= Sonar (locate other subs from above)
R2 ê	= Change view (I wouldn't mess with it)

If you want to get Yuffie, walk around some time in the forests on the
world map, until you come to battle a Mystery Ninja. The first forest you
encounter on the world map are the ones near Junon. Beat her, and go through the
dialog like this: NEVER enter the menu, and NEVER use the save point. Talk to
her. Answer:

&quot;Not Interested&quot;
&quot;.êpetrified&quot;
&quot;Wait a second!&quot;
&quot;.êThat's right&quot;
&quot;.êLet's hurry on&quot;

Now you'll name her (Yuffie) and she'll be part of your party! Forever! Not
sure if you're going to like her personality though ..heh. ;) If you make a
mistake or enter the Menu, Yuffie will steal a sum of money from you, and
vanish.

Yuffie comes with the Throw Materia, that allows you to throw stuff at enemies
to cause damage (and later throw money). You can give it to someone else if you
like, or start using Yuffie(she's also a long range character, which gives her
a pretty big advantage over others). Put her in the back row.

You can enter the Ancient Forest once you've beaten Ultimate Weapon, OR bred
yourself a Mountain Chocobo (or better). It's the little green bulb with red
dots on a canyon near Cosmo Canyon. The Highwind can't land here due to the
many forests.

Once you've entered, you'll find that this area is a puzzle. You must make your
way though each area.. and obtain the treasures (that's what you're here for,
I assume). There are various things that stand in your way, or can help you.
By pressing Square, you'll end up at the start (if you get stuck this is useful
but you'll have to do everything all over again!)

o Insects: Can be placed in Pitcher Flowers, but will be eaten quickly. They
  can also be placed in front of a Hollow Tree to lure out a Frog.

o Frogs: Can be placed in Pitcher Flowers, but won't be eaten. Instead they
  will jump out. If Cloud is standing on it he'll get launched far away (which
  can be useful at times)

o Beehive: Can be thrown into a Large Flytrap, this will keep it closed.

o Pitcher Flower: Can be used as a bridge or catapult by placing Insects or
  Frogs in it respectively.

o Stamen: These pink stamen can be used to swing Cloud across areas or ledges.

o Hollow Tree: When placing an Insect in front of this, a Frog will come out.

Area 1:
-ê
Grab the three Insects and place them close by the ledge that leads to the
Pitcher Flowers. When all three Insects are here, you'll have enough time to
place them in the Pitcher Flowers one by one, and jump across. The Large</span><span id="faqspan-12">
Flytrap holds a Supershot ST in the middle that can be reached by walking
slightly from the right. Don't go all the way to the middle or you'll get..
well, eaten. More to the right of this area is a Spring Gun Clip if you walk
behind the tree. Head to Area 2.

Area 2:
-ê
This area isn't too hard either. First grab the Insect, then walk more to the
right and jump up with the Stamen. Here, place the Insect in the Pitcher Flower
or alternatively lure the Frog out and put that in the Pitcher Flower. Jump
across the Pitcher Flowers to the right. Now that you're across the Large
Flytrap, pick up the nearby Frog and walk to the right. There are two Pitcher
Flowers here which you can walk to from the small ledge. Place the Frog in the
left Pitcher Flower and have Cloud jump on the Pitcher Flower. Keep him there
and he'll get launched to the platform with a Beehive. Grab it and jump off.
Walk near the Large Flytrap and place the Beehive in it. Grab the Slash All
Materia. Walk to the right again, grab another Frog, place it in the right
Pitcher Flower this time, have Cloud stand on it, and he'll get launched to the
right. Oh, and that other item will be gotten soon.

Area 3:
-ê
First walk a bit to the right and grab the Insect. Walk back and place it in
the Pitcher Flower. Quickly grab the other Insect too and make your way to the
Stamen. Cloud is hurled to the upper level. Here, it may be useful to have the
Area headers on (with Select). Walk a bit to the left, after which you'll want
to go all the way to the right so you can grab the Typoon Materia. After
getting that, walk all the way to the left and go down there so you'll end up
in Area 2 where the Minerva Band lies for the taking. After this, repeat the
process with the Frog (in the right Pitcher Flower) to reach the right part
again, and walk back to Area 3.

Make your way back to the treetops. Here, walk to the middle (which is on the
right from where you start). and head down there. Walk down the rope. Grab the
Insect here, and place it in the Pitcher Flower to reach the Beehive. Grab the
Beehive, put it in the Large Flytrap, grab the Insect, walk past the Large
Flytrap and you'll be on the left side of the area again. Here, grab a Insect
and lure the Frog out of the Hollow Tree. Leave it, and grab the Insect all the
way to the left. Place it in the Pitcher Flower all the way to the right (but
still on the left of the Large Flytrap), grab the Frog, and put that Frog in
the Pitcher Flower all the way to the right. Have Cloud stand on it and you'll
be launched to the entrance of Area 4.

Area 4:
-ê
This is no puzzle, just a Cave with the precious Apocalypse, a weapon for Cloud
with TRIPLE Materia Growth. Oh yeah, there's an Elixir in here too. Exit the
Cave and you'll be back on the world map. After all, you've got the 7 treasure
of the Ancient Forest. Heh, 7 again huh? That number sure does pop up a lot in
the game.. Coincidence?

{OPT-7.1} Lucrecia's Cave |
-ê'
Treasure: Chaos, Death Penalty.

Once you've gotten either a Green or Blue Chocobo, OR the Submarine, you can
check out the waterfall cave west the Gold Saucer, and southwest of North
Corel. Have Vincent in your party and a scene will happen. After this, fight 10
random battles (though you can't get encounters near the waterfall) and return
here with Vincent again. You'll receive his Ultimate Limit Break: Chaos, and
his Ultimate Weapon: Death Penalty.

{OPT-7.2} The backroom |

Treasure: Fullcure Materia, Elixir, Magic Source

Once you've gotten the Highwind, head to Cosmo Canyon. Enter the Item Shop on
the far right, and go behind the back. This was blocked off at first. Now you
can grab the Fullcure Materia, along with the Elixir and Magic Source.

-ê".
{OPT-7.3} Treasure at Rocket Town |
-ê"'
Treasure: Fourth Bracelet, Guard Source

Once you've gotten the Highwind, head back to Rocket Town. Head into the weapon
store and grab a Fourth Bracelet from the chest in the other room. This is a
rather good armor, although the Magic Defense from armor is NEVER used from any
armor. So ignore that.. your Mdef will always be based on just your Spirit
Stat. It's still a good armor for now. Now go to the Item Shop (with the Old
Man outside) and grab a Guard Source from the room behind.

-ê.
{OPT-7.4} Chocobo Sage |
-ê'
Treasure: Enemy Skill Materia

Once you've gotten the Highwind, fly over to the House surrounded by mountains
east of Icicle Inn, and nearby the cave exit of the Coral Valley Cave. Talk to
the Green Chocobo to receive the 4th (and final) Enemy Skill Materia. The
Chocobo Sage himself can supply you with hints, and the more he tells you, the
more you can tell Chole at the Chocobo Farm. He'll remember a new thing when
you fight between 3 and 6 battles. He also sells some of the best Nuts/Greens.

-ê.
{OPT-7.5} Cactus Island |
-ê'
Good Morph: Tetra Elemental

From Cosmo Canyon, fly to the southwest from there, and you should be able to
locate an island called Cactus Island. You can land on the grass, and fight
Cactuers in the desert. The reason to come here is that they can be morphed
into a Tetra Elemental, an accessory that absorbs Fire, Ice, Earth and
Lightning. The Cactuers pack a punch with their 1000 Needles attack that always
does 1000 damage, and their normal 'Mystery Kick' that can do around 750
damage. They are also very hard to hit, in fact you only have 1/8th chance you
can hit them normally with physical attacks. Fortunately, there are ways to
morph them easily. The Cactuers are level 40, so if you cast the Enemy Skill
Level 4 Suicide on them they'll instantly have very low HP. You can now do two
things: You can manipulate them, making them an easy target for morphing, or
you can paralyse them using the item Dazers (gotten from Boundfat enemies in
the Corral Valley, just north from the Sleeping Forest). Either way works just
fine. I suggest you get 3 of them, for whenever you want one for any party
member.

-ê.
{OPT-7.6} Villa Costa Del Sol |
-ê'
Yes, this is the Villa that came on the house market when President Shinra was
killed (Rufus his father). You can in fact buy this the first time you get to
Costa Del Sol, but it's more than obvious many players won't have 30ê gil to
buy it. So when you are on Disc2/3 and have sold 'All' Materia's for 1.4 mil
gold a piece, come back and buy the house. The items in the basement can be
gotten without buying it, and the only thing that it grants you is that you can
sleep here and that it's named 'Villa Cloud'.

Treasure: Key to Sector 5, Premium Heart, Sneak Glove.

After you've got Cloud back in your party on Disc 2, after getting the Highwind
go to Bone Village. Check this picture: www.shillatime.org/bonevillage.jpg

Go dig at either spot 5, 6 or 7. You will get the Key to Sector 5, which allows
you to enter Midgar again. Head to Midgar (and guess what, the guy there
lost his key on an excavation tour .. tough luck!). If you go inside the church
you can witness a glitch of Aeris. Head to Wall Market and go to the store that
says 'Item'. In here, try and use the machine to receive the Premium Heart,
Tifa's Ultimate Weapon. A funny scene will happen if you have Cid and Tifa in
your party.

Now head to the weapon store up north. Talk to the guy who sold you the
batteries and he'll offer you a new bargain *cough sucker cough*. He'll sell
you the Sneak Glove for a whopping 129000 gil. It's a great item though, as it
increases your stealing chances by a lot.. so you can't get around it if you
want to have it.

-ê!.
{OPT-7.9} Cave with Sleeping Man |
-ê!'
Treasure: Mythril, Bolt Ring.

There is a cave behind a river on the west/northwest of the Mythril Mines,
which you might've noticed earlier. You can reach it by using the buggy to
cross the shallow part(or, much later, the Highwind or colored chocobos). In
the cave is a sleeping man who will tell you either how many times you've
fought battles, how many times you have escaped, or that large materia needs
high level materia..With that he is hinting at how Master Materia works.

What use is this to us? If the last two digits of the amount of battles you're
fought in total are the same, the man will wake up and give you an item. If the
numbers are odd (11, 33, 55, 77, 99) you will get the Key Item 'Mythril', which
will be useful later. If the last two numbers are even - with the notable
exception of double zero, which leaves 22, 44, 66, 88) you'll get a Bolt Ring,
which is an accessory that nullifies all Bolt attacks.

You can only hold one Mythril at a time, but you can acquire a new piece of
Mythril if you don't have one at the time.  The Bolt Ring is only given once.


-ê.
{OPT-7.10} The Weapon Seller |
-ê'
Treasure: Great Gospel, Gold Armlet.

Head over to the single house south of the Gold Saucer.. remember? You can use
the river running through the western continent to get there faster. This
weapon dealer knows a great deal about the Keystone.. but he sold it to Dio,
the owner of the Gold Saucer. You can also sleep here for FREE, if you check
out the bed. He's also looking for some Mythril.

Get the Mythril (see {OPT-7.9}) and go back to the Weapon Seller's house. Give
it to him, and he'll let you open up either the small box upstairs, or the
large box downstairs. The large box holds a Gold Armlet, the small one is Great
Gospel, Aeris' her final Limit Break. Needless to say, go for the small box.
You might also want to take your time to um, well, teach Aeris this Limit
Break. It's a very good one. Note: You can get infinite Great Gospels if you
keep getting just the small box.

{OPT-7.11} The Turtle's Paradise Flyers |

Megalixir.

There's a contest held by the Turtle's Paradise Pub in Wutai. You must read 6
Flyers all over the world, and if you have, you'll get a prize! Where are they?
1) In the Sector 5 Slums, in the room with the boy you can steal 5 gil from or
leave it and get a Turbo Ether later.
2) First floor of the Shinra Building, upper right corner on the bulletin. Read
the whole bulletin and you'll come across it. This is the hardest flyer, as you
only get TWO chances: During the first raid, and during the return when you
parachute back into Midgar.
3) This is in the main lobby of the Gold Saucer's Ghost Hotel. About the only
useful thing you can do there.
4) In Cosmo Canyon, attached on the Tiger Lily Arms Shop.
5) Also in Cosmo Canyon, at the Inn, next to the Innkeepers' counter.
6) Inside Wutai itself, in the hallway of Yuffie's lower room (where you get
trapped).
7) Huh? Weren't there only 6? Yes, there are 6 Flyers, but make sure you also
read the contest sign outside of the Turtle's Paradise Pub itself. If you don't
read it, how would Cloud know there's a contest in the first place?

The reward is one of each Stat Source, plus a Megalixir.

some plot holes.

{OPT-7.13} Creating Master Materia from Huge Materia|
-ê4'
If you've done everything right, you should have all 4 of the Huge Materia.
However, if you failed one or more of the missions, you will not have them all.
Below is a small chart to see which you get when you fail some missions:

Fail Nothing: êYou will have 4: Yellow, Green, Red, Blue.
Fail 1 Mission:  You will have 3: Yellow, Green, Red.
Fail 2 Missions: You will have 2: Yellow, Green.
Fail 3 Missions: You will have 1: Yellow.
Fail 4 Missions: You will have 0.

As you can see, it does not matter which you failed. It does not matter if you
fail to get the one at Fort Condor, or the one from the Rocket. In either case,
the Blue Huge Materia will be lost to you. If you've only missed the Blue
Huge Materia, you can no longer get a 'perfect' game. You can, however, still
dig up Bahamut ZERO from Bone Village, if that's all you're interested in.
Refer to section {M4} for this.

If you return to Bugenhagen's observatory with all mastered Magic Materia,
you'll get the Master Magic Materia. If you have mastered all Summon Materia,
you'll get the Master Summon Materia. If you have mastered the following of the
Command Materia: Deathblow, Manipulate, Mime, Morph, Sense, Steal, Throw. Then
you will receive Master Command. Just inspect the Huge Materia of the color you
have the mastered materia of. Your Mastered Materia will merge, and you lose
those individual materia. Master Summon allows summons to be cast without a
restriction per battle. You can re-create infinite Master Materia, as the Huge
Materia will keep on existing.

Master Support or Master Independent Materia don't exist.

but you must inspect it anyway before you can do the rest of this mini-quest.

There's not much inside the Accessory shop on the lower left of Mideel, but
there's an item to be found near the man outside of it. Nearby on the left
you'll hear a screeched sound. Inspect it and you'll get the 'Beat-Up Useless
Old Key'. Now head to the weapon shop and try the key on the door in the back.
Tell the truth to the owner and you'll receive the Curse Ring! The Curse Ring
is a good accessory that increases your stats like this: Str +35, Mag +25, Dex
+15, Vit +15, Spirit + 15, Luck + 10. However, at the start of the battle
you'll automatically get Death Sentenced, meaning the equipped character dies
within 60 seconds. You can easily counter this by casting 'Death Force' on the
character.

{OPT-7.15} The Kalm Traveller |
-ê'
Treasure: Master Command, Master Magic, Master Summon, Gold Chocobo.

After getting the Highwind, go back to Kalm and enter the rightmost house.
Head up the stairs to find a man who's in search of three items: Guide Book,
Earth Harp, Desert Rose. If you give them to him, he'll reward you greatly..
The Guide Book is gotten by morphing a Ghost Ship (found in either the Under-
water Reactor tunnel or Battle Square). The reward is an Underwater Materia.
This Materia removes the 20 minutes timer from the battle with Emerald. As for
the Earth Harp and Desert Rose.. you only have to defeat Emerald and Ruby
respectively. The rewards are the Three Master Materia (for the Earth Harp),
and a Gold Chocobo (for the Desert Rose). Interested in beating the WEAPONs?

{OPT-7.16} The 4 Secret Materia Caves |
-ê&'
You may have seen them before, those elusive caves around the world map that you
couldn't reach by foot, nor by Highwind. There's 4 of them, and each holds a
unique materia.

1: Quadra Magic
-ê
The first materia cave you can visit is the one that's located on an island
northeast of Mideel. It's an island with a green part and a rocky gray part.
The parts are separated by a small cliff. Normally this cave can be reached by
the Blue, Black, and Gold Chocobos. I say normally, because there is a trick
that you can perform with the Highwind, so that you land on the rocky part of
the island, thus gaining access to the materia cave. The trick can be, well,
tricky to do, but once you get it you'll see that it's not impossible to pull
off. This is how you do the trick:

Fly with the Highwind to the east of the Chocobo Ranch and spot the Cave.
Follow the dirt path from the cave until you see a cliff that leads to a grass
area. This is the spot you need to be at. The trick is to fly/land the Highwind
near the cliff so that when you land, you'll actually be on the dirt area
leading to the Cave that's normally still unreachable. To do this, face the
Highwind south, and use Square + Directional buttons to move it around. When
nearby the ledge, press X to land, and also hold the Up/Left buttons along with
L1. If done correctly, you'll be next to the ledge on the dirt area. It's kinda
tricky, but give it a few tries and I'm sure you'll be able to pull it off.

Here's a video that shows how it's done (on Youtube). Note, this video is not
mine, nor do I take credit for it. All credits go out to the original poster of
the video. Go here: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vhDDj_b1hek

2: Mime
-ê
This cave is on the Wutai continent. It's on the eastern part, and it can only
be reached by a Green, Black, or Gold Chocobo. Go inside to get the Yellow Mime
materia.

3: HP&lt;-&gt;MP
-ê

This materia cave is located north of North Corel, and is cut-off from the
continent by mountains, a desert, and a river. Therefore, you can only access
the cave with a Black or Gold chocobo. Yeah, you're probably wondering what
good a Blue chocobo is. Well, they can access Lucrecia's Cave..(so can the
Submarine, though). They can also access the cave with the sleeping man...

4: Knights of the Round
-ê
The last cave is also the hardest to get to. The round island at the northeast
corner of the world map can only be accessed by a Gold Chocobo. Your reward is
precious: The best summon one can wish for: Knights of the Round.

Ultimate Weapon appears for the first time during Mideel. This is the only
mandatory battle, however. There are more optional battles, and you can fight
Ultimate Weapon on the World Map after beating Diamond Weapon. However, you may
find difficulties with this due to the story progressing when you fly above the
Northern Crater and Midgar. So you may want to do this on Disc 3. Otherwise,
just save your game often and reset if things don't go your way.

Ultimate Weapon can be fought on several places. Also depending on where you
fight him, you can steal different things from him. The following table is
pretty much a modified one from Kao Megura's FAQ. Credits go to him:

 ê.-ê2.
 ê|Location ê|Battle Type|Item to steal: |
 ê|-ê|-ê|-ê|

 ê|Northern Crater ê|Ground ê|  Reflect Ring |
 ê|Cosmo Area (Final) ê|Aerial ê| ê--- ê|
 ê'-ê2'

After he flies away, you'll have to find him again, and this can be a major
pain at times. He won't fly to his next destination if you don't bump into him
about 4 times (often the magic number here). So that means flying over the
world trying to find him. You can also leave the game for a bit, and when you
come back Cid should be swearing, which is a sign Ultimate bumped into you
himself.

&lt;Perfect Game Note 31:&gt;
~êP
Make sure you steal the Curse Ring the first time you battle him. Even more
important, make SURE you steal 99 (or 98 since you should have one) Reflect
Rings from him, as they can't be gotten anywhere else. This takes a really,
really long time. I suggest you steal 10 a day, then you're at least done after
10 days. Note that you shouldn't hurt Ultimate Weapon during the battles...

Also note that after each battle it will always first spawn above lake Junon
(but it'll immediately start moving, so quickly move there), after which you'll
have to ram into it several times to force it to another fixed point where it
can be fought.
~êP

Note that Ultimate Weapon may have 10ê HP, but this carries over ALL battles,
even starting at the mandatory battle. Ultimate Weapon can never heal his HP. To
protect against his Ultima Beam, put an Elemental Materia paired with any
Materia that doesn't have an element, in your ARMOR (except Support Materia
which doesn't work). This will protect against an invisible element called
'Hidden'. Ultima Beam is the only damaging attack that has this element, so
protect yourself from it. An example combo is MP Plus-Elemental. Also equip a
Long Range Materia on Cloud and use Long Range characters (or rely on magic).
Bump into him with the Highwind when you're ready.

Ultimate Weapon will return to the planet, leaving a big-ass crater allowing
you to walk normally into the Ancient Forest without a chocobo, if you want to.
Oh, and he also drops this funny looking sword called after him, Ultimate
Weapon. Oh, and it's Cloud's Ultimate Weapon, gotten from Ultimate Weapon.

Once you've obtained the Submarine it becomes possible to challenge Emerald
Weapon. If you go in un-prepared, he'll kill you with a sneeze, snort, and a
water fart, not necessarily in that order. In all seriousness he's just a really
tough boss, only available to the US and PAL versions, and to the JP
International Version.

You only have 20 minutes to beat Emerald, since the fight takes place under
water. If you equip someone with the Underwater Materia, this timer will go
away (for the whole battle). Check the Kalm Traveller section for more
information on how to acquire it.

|General Information: ê:|
|-ê ê9|
|Aire Tam Storm does 1ê damage for every materia equipped on a character. So |
|it doesn't always do 9ê damage. Therefore, I suggest you never use more than|
|8 materia on a character in this battle. If you do, have the Final Attack- ê|
|Revive combo ready or else you're dead. Aire Tam = Materia if you spell it ê|
|backwards. Aire Tam Storm and Emerald Beam are both ONLY used if Emerald has  |
|one or more eyes left/open. Revenge Stamp is his counter attack, but only when|
|at least one or more eyes are open. His Foot Stamp and Emerald Shoot attacks  |
|are only used when all eyes are dead/closed. This pretty much covers his ê|
|attacks. Many of his attacks de-spell good statuses, such as Barrier, Regen,  |
|Haste, and many more. It's therefore not really worth it to protect yourself  |
|with them. As for the weapon you should equip.. all I'm going to say is that  |
|Ultimate Weapons have ZERO growth, so you won't get a single point of that ê|
|whopping nice 50ê AP if you use them. ê'|
|-ê) ê%|
|Armor: Mystile (or Ziedrich, but Mystile is better, since Emerald ONLY uses   |
|non-elemental attacks and Mystile has better evasion than Ziedrich, which is  |
|a lot better than the +35 extra physical defense the Ziedrich gives.) ê	|
|Accessory: Circlet, Tough Ring, (or Champion Belt) ê|
| êN|

|Gravity-MP Absorb, W-Magic-HP Plus ê,|
|-ê) ê%|
|As you can see, Emerald can be slowed, and you can also damage him with ê|
|Gravity. Although halved, this still does 9ê damage through the most part of|
|the battle. With the above Materia setup, your character will do 8 times 9ê |
|damage until Emerald starts getting low on HP. Besides, you gain enough HP/MP |
|to keep you going, and since you have 8 Materia, Aire Tam Storm won't kill you|
|if you have max HP. To make the battle easier, use Ink on him to Darkness him,|
|and also cast Slow on him. Use Megalixirs for curing. On an interesting note, |
|if your characters are Level 99 when facing Emerald, Goblin Punch can do high |
|damage (up to 9ê of course) because you're the same level as him. Goblin ê|
|Punch is an Enemy Skill that doesn't use MP. ê"|
| êN|
|Strategy 2: Abusing Mime ê6|
|-ê ê6|
|Materia Setup: Mime on all three characters, Knights of the Round-W-Summon on |
|one character. ê@|
|-ê ê/|
|After casting KotR (twice), keep miming it until Emerald dies. A cheap but ê|
|effective strategy. ê;|
| êN|
|Strategy 3: Lucky 7ê: ê7|
|-ê ê6|
|Materia Setup: HP Plus and an other Materia, two Materia on each character.   |
|-ê ê6|
|This setup will have Aire Tam Storm cause 2ê damage, putting characters with|
|9ê HP into lucky 7ê. This will cause 64 hits of 7ê damage. If you have  |
|your characters fill up their Limit Breaks before the battle (and use either  |
|Yuffie -&gt;Doom of the Living, Barret -&gt;Ungarmax, Cid -&gt;Highwind, and of course |
|Cloud -&gt;Omnislash) you can use those afterwards and all hits will do 7ê ê|
|damage. If you have a Mime materia, have the character who used their limit   |
|break the last, mime, and you'll probably have killed Emerald. You could also |
|just hack and slash away. Alternatively you can put your characters in Lucky  |
|7ê before the battle to make things easier. You can check how to do that at |
|the Lucky 7ê section. ê7|

Also only available on US, PAL and JP International Versions, Ruby Weapon
appears after beating Ultimate Weapon (thus after Diamond Weapon as well), AND
having fought ONE RANDOM BATTLE AFTER that. Ruby's head sticks out of the
Desert surrounding the Gold Saucer, and you'll notice what's meant with head
when you bump into it. Before you attempt it, I suggest you prepare yourself
accordingly. You can bump into it with either the Highwind or a Gold Chocobo.

|-êN|
|General Information: ê:|
|-ê ê9|
|Ruby Weapon is invincible to ALL attacks until it sticks its tentacles in the |
|sand. Furthermore, when its tentacles aren't in the sand it'll use Whirlsand  |
|on two party members (removing them from battle, flagging them as dead). In   |
|order to prevent this, knock out two characters before entering this battle   |
|and cast Life2 on both KO'd characters after Ruby sticks its tentacles in the |
|sand. êI|
| êN|
|Do note that Ruby will still be able to use Whirlsand later on, even if its   |
|tentacles are in the ground; after respectively Ruby's 25th and 32nd rounds   |
|it will perform the dreaded attack again, so be sure not to endlessly stall   |
|the battle. êC|
| êN|
|Ruby has very high defensive stats, so you may find it difficult effectively  |
|damaging it. Armor piercing attacks (such as Pandora's Box, KOTR, or any of   |
|the Bahamut summons) work well because of this, although most of these attacks|
|have very long animation sequences. Keep in mind that Ruby normally counters  |
|KOTR with a casting of Ultima. ê0|
| êN|
|Recommended equipment: ê8|
|-ê ê8|
|Armor: Mystile (or Ziedrich) ê2|
|Accessory: Ribbon ê=|
| êN|
|Strategy 1: Taking advantages of Ruby's Weaknesses: ê|
|-ê4 ê|
|Where Emerald Weapon had some exploitable elemental weaknesses, Ruby's soft   |
|spot are bad status effects. Paralyse is by far the most useful to us, as it  |
|will render Ruby completely harmless for a short period of time. Although ê|
|Hades inflicts it on Ruby, you can most likely only cast it up to five times  |
|(since only Master Summon grants unlimited castings of summons). Fortunately  |
|the item 'Dazers' also inflicts Paralyse and can be stolen (or morphed/won)   |
|from Boundfat creatures in the Coral Valley. Alternatively you can steal some |
|from Battery Caps in forest close to Mt. Nibel and Rocket Town. ê|
| êN|
|Have one character repeatedly throw Dazers at Ruby to keep him paralyzed at   |
|all times, while the other two characters perform the strongest attacks they  |
|have at their disposal. Should you want to further minimize any possible ê|
|risks, now's a good time to also inflict Slow on Ruby, should he ever snap ê|
|out of his paralyzed state. Although Ruby is weak to Darkness, this status ê|
|effect is broken and doesn't make any difference whatsoever. ê|
| êN|
|To speed things up, cast Big Guard on your party and boost their attack and   |
|defense with Hero Drinks (4 of those on each character reaches the bonus' ê|
|limits). êF|
| êN|
|Strategy 2: Minimalizing Ruby's attacks: ê&|
|-ê) ê%|
|Materia: At least Elemental (level 3+) linked to Fire in ARMOR. ê|
| êN|
|Again, based on when Ruby has its tentacles in the sand. When the tentacles   |
|are in the sand, Ruby cannot use Big Claw, Big Swing, Whirlsand or Comet2. ê|
|Ruby Flame is fire based, so that's free healing for everyone who has the ê|
|Elemental-Fire combo in their armor. Leaves us with Ultima, Shadow Flare, the |
|Tentacles and Ruby Ray. Those first two attacks are rather powerful, but there|
|are ways around them. Shadow Flare can be reflected, although this isn't a ê|
|good idea to cast that just for that attack. It's better to prevent Ultima and|
|Shadow Flare both from being cast by having Ruby run out of MP. He's got 2560 |
|MP, which is a lot, but 26 castings of Magic Hammer will do the trick, so that|
|is where you'll be focusing on. With all three characters doing it, you'll be |
|doing it for about 9-10 turns. After this, all that's left is the tentacle ê|
|attacks and Ruby Ray. The tentacles cannot kill you, since they always take a |
|certain % of your HP away. They also cause bad status effects, but giving ê|
|everyone a Ribbon prevents this. Ruby Ray cannot be prevented, but it's far   |
|from being the worst attack in the game. It's base damage is 4662, and it's   |
|only directed at one character. If you have Ziedrich equipped the damage will |
|even be halved due to a special element. Now it's all just a matter of healing|
|with Megalixirs and perhaps 'feeding' your characters some Hero Drinks to ê|
|boost attack and defense. For just boosting defense you can also cast Dragon  |
|Force. Attack Ruby with attacks like 4x Cut if you've got good strength.. or  |
|use Ultima/Comet2 with W-magic/Quadra Magic. ê"|
| êN|
|Strategy 3: Knight of the Round with Dazers: ê"|
|-ê- ê!|
|A well known strategy, this basically involves using W-Summon (KOTR) and ê|
|Dazers to prevent Ruby from countering with Ultima. Even if something does go |
|wrong, you still have a chance that Mystile dodges Ultima. ê|

Note: Ultimate Weapons have ZERO Materia Growth!
-ê

Note: Don't understand the formulas for Ultimate Weapons? Check out the
-ê mechanics section where it's explained in a simple fashion.

-ê#.
Cloud: Ultimate Weapon &amp; Omnislash |
-ê#'
Ultimate Weapon is won when you beat Ultimate WEAPON. Y'know, the large flying
creature. Ultimate WEAPON appears after fighting Diamond WEAPON. Also check
section {WEA-1} for more info.

Power Up = [(3 * Power * Cloud's HP) / Cloud's Max HP] + 1
(In other words, the higher the difference between Clouds Max HP and Current HP
the weaker the weapon. The less the difference, the more powerful. This weapon
even changes color! Notice it becoming more blue when weaker.)

Omnislash can be bought for 51200 Battle Points at the Gold Saucer's Battle
Square, after you've gotten the Tiny Bronco. After getting the Highwind on
Disc2, the amount of points needed is lowered to 32000 BP.

-ê$.
Barret: Missing Score &amp; Catastrophe |
-ê$'
Missing Score is found in a chest on the stairs leading to Hojo, during the
Midgar Raid at the end of Disc2. The chest ONLY appears if Barret is in your
party.

Power Up = [Power * [Total AP on Weapon / 10ê] / 16] + 1
(In other words, the more AP-heavy materia in the weapon, the more powerful it
is. Underwater Materia adds no AP, even if you gained some on it.)

Catastrophe can be gotten at any time after the Huge Materia events at North
Corel. The lady in the middle house on the west side of town will give you
this. She has a green bandana. Note: It is rumored that Catastrophe can also
be dug up in Bone Village. I have never seen any proof on this, so even if it's
true it's ridiculously rare, and there's no need to get it from there.

-ê#.
Tifa: Premium Heart &amp; Final Heaven |
-ê#'
Premium Heart is in the 'Item' labeled shop in Wall Market. First of all, head
to Bone Village. Here, ask for a search (doesn't matter what, except no Lunar
Harp.. duh). Now just skip placing diggers and planting bombs, and walk to the
upper level. Here, stand near the ledge, in the middle between the smoke and
the campfire. Mark the spot, and the next morning grab the Key Item 'Key to
Sector 5'. Head to Wall Market and go to the store that says 'Item'. In here,
try and use the machine to receive the Premium Heart, Tifa's Ultimate Weapon. A
funny scene will happen if you have Cid and Tifa in your party.

Power Up = [Power * [Tifa's Limit Level * Limit Bar Units / 16] / 16] + 1
(In other words, the higher level Tifa's Limit Break is set to, and the fuller
her Limit Bar is, the more damage this does. This weapon therefore always does
good damage during her limit breaks, but may suck without a full limit bar.)

Final Heaven can be gotten by having Tifa in your party and returning to the
Piano in her room after Cloud 'finds himself' on Disc2. Play the following:
X, [], Triangle, R1+Triangle, R1+[], X, [], Triangle, R1+X, O, X, [], X.

-ê%.
Aeris: Princess Guard &amp; Great Gospel |
-ê%'
Princess Guard is found in the chest at the end of walkway Iê at the Clock
Room in the Temple of the Ancients.

Power Up = x2 if one character is dead, x3 if 2 characters are dead
(In other words, it becomes more powerful with team members KO'd.)

Great Gospel can be gotten after getting the Tiny Bronco. Remember the sleeping
man in the cave on the eastern continent? If not, I'll refresh your memory:
There is a cave behind a river on the west/northwest of the Mythril Mines,
which you might've noticed earlier. You can reach it by using the buggy to
cross the shallow part. You can take the buggy to the other continent by just
riding it into Costa Del Sol/Junon.You can't access it with the Tiny Bronco. In
the cave is a sleeping man who will tell you either how many times you've
fought battles, how many times you have escaped, or that large materia needs
high level materia..What use is this to us? If the last two digits of the
number you have fought are the same, the man will wake up and give you an item.
If the numbers are odd (11,33,55,etc) you will get the Key Item 'Mythril',
which will be useful now. Get the Mythril and go back to the Weapon Seller's
house. Give it to him, and he'll let you open up either the small box upstairs,
or the large box downstairs. The large box holds a Gold Armlet, the small one</span><span id="faqspan-13">
is Great Gospel, Aeris' her final Limit Break. Needless to say, go for the
small box. You might also want to take your time to um, well, teach Aeris this
Limit Break. It's a very good one.

-ê&.
Red XIII: Limited Moon &amp; Cosmo Memory |
-ê&'
Limited Moon is gotten from Bugenhagen in Cosmo Canyon if you return here after
taking Bugenhagen to the Forgotten Capital. You can also do this on Disc3.

Power Up = [(3 * Power * Red XIII's MP) / Red XIII's Max MP] + 1
(In other words, the larger the difference between Red XIII's Max MP and
Current MP, the weaker the weapon. The lesser the difference, the more powerful
the weapon.)

Cosmo Memory is won when you beat Lost Number in the Shinra Mansion. Check this
guide for {OPT-5} and you'll find the section that guides you through the
Mansion.

-ê!.
Yuffie: Conformer &amp; All Creation |
-ê!'
The Conformer is found in a chest in the Gelnika. This chest is in the upper
left corner of the first room north of the first hallway. The chest can't be
seen, so just press circle and you'll open it.

Power Up = [Power * Enemy Level/16]
(In other words, the higher the enemy level, the more powerful the weapon.
Ability powers are overwritten, so Morph deals normal damage instead of 1/8.)

All Creation is gotten by beating Godo in Wutai. Check sections {OPT-3} and
possibly {OPT-2} for more info.

-ê.
Cid: Venus Gospel &amp; Highwind |
-ê'
Venus Gospel is gotten by talking to the Old Man in Rocket Town several times,
after the Rocket has been launched.

Power Up = [(3 * Power * Cid's MP) / Cid's Max MP] + 1
(In other words, the larger the difference between Cid's Max MP and Current MP,
the weaker the weapon. The lesser the difference, the more powerful the
weapon.)

Highwind is found in a chest in the room with the broken helicopter. The chest
is on the lower right of the screen.

-ê.
Vincent: Death Penalty &amp; Chaos |
-ê'
Both Death Penalty and Chaos are found in the waterfall cave. Once you've
gotten either a Green or Blue Chocobo, OR the Submarine, you can check out the
waterfall cave west the Gold Saucer, and southwest of North Corel. Have Vincent
in your party and a scene will happen. After this, fight 10 random battles
(though you can't get encounters near the waterfall) and return here with
Vincent again. You'll receive his Ultimate Limit Break: Chaos, and his Ultimate
Weapon: Death Penalty.

[Power * [Vincent's Kills / 128] / 16] + 10
(In other words, the more enemies Vincent kills, no matter with which weapon,
the more powerful Death Penalty becomes. This can even cause overflow damage at
very high kills.)

-ê.
Cait Sith: HP Shout (&amp; Slots) |
-ê'
The HP Shout is found in one of the lockers on floor 63 of the Shinra Building.
You can ONLY get this during the Midgar Raid on Disc2.. so make SURE you get it
already.

Power Up = [(3 * Power * Cait Sith's HP) / Cait Sith's Max HP] + 1
(In other words, the higher the difference between Cait's Max HP and Current HP
the weaker the weapon. The less the difference, the more powerful.)

Cait Sith's best limit break is Slots, with many possible combo's. There is no
Manual for this and it's gotten like any other regular Limit Break.

Level (Lvl):
-ê
Character levels are basically a rough indication of how 'good' a character is.
When a character levels up, he/she will gain a bonus in their stats. HP and MP
can only be increased by level ups. The other stats can be increased by items
called 'Sources', besides the regular increase through levels.

When a character joins the team, their level is based on party's average level.
This varies by character: ê.-ê.-ê.
Barret ê= [average party level - 1] ê|Cloud's Lvl | Yuffie's Lvl|
Tifa ê= [average party level - 2] ê|-ê|-ê|
Aeris ê= [average party level - 3] ê|   1-20 ê| ê17 ê|

Cid ê= [average party level + 3] ê|  36-40 ê| ê37 ê|
Yuffie ê= [Depends on Cloud's level; See table] |  41-99 ê| ê42 ê|
 ê2'-ê'-ê'

HP (Hit Points):
-ê
HP is a character's life. When depleted, the character will be KO'd in battle.
When the HP of all characters in your party is depleted, it will be game over.
HP is increased when a character levels up.

MP (Magic Points):
-ê
MP is used to cast Magic. Every spell requires a certain amount of MP to be
cast. The points are deducted after the casting. When you have insufficient MP
to cast a certain spell, you simply can't it.

Strength (Str):
-ê
Strength is used to power up a character's physical attacks. The higher your
Str, the higher damage you will do with physical attacks.

Vitality (Vit):
-ê
Vitality is used to power up a character's defense against physical attacks.
The higher your Vit, the less damage you'll receive from enemy attacks that
fall under physical attacks.

Magic (Mag):
-ê
Magic is used to power up the magic that a character can use. This includes
summons as well as regular magic and enemy skills. The higher your Mag, the
higher damage you'll hit with magic.

Spirit (Spr):
-ê
Spirit is used to power up a character's defense against magical attacks. The
higher your Spr, the less damage you'll take from enemy attacks that fall under
magical attacks. This is an important stat, because there is a bug in the game
that causes the magical defense that armor gives not to be taken in account.
This means your magic defense is always just your Spirit stat.

Dexterity (Dex):
-ê
Dexterity is basically the speed of your characters, and it determines how fast
their bars will fill up. Dexterity is ALSO an important part of a characters
evasion against physical attacks.
Thus, it's part of Defense% (= Physical Evasion). The higher your Dex, the
faster your character will be, and the more physical attacks they will evade.

Luck (Lck):
-ê
Luck increases the chance to perform a critical hit with physical attacks. It
ALSO increases the chance to get a 'lucky evade' in which case you will evade
physical attacks. The higher your Lck, the more critical hits
you will perform, and the more attacks you will evade. The chance formula for
getting a lucky evade is like this: % = [Luck/4]. Max Luck (255) would give you
a 63% chance because [] means you round down.


Then there are the derived stats, which are used in battle. They consist out
of the primary stats, which are discussed above.

Attack ê	(Atk) = Str + Weapon Attack Bonus
Attack% ê(At%) = Weapon Attack% Bonus
Defense ê(Def) = Vit + Armour Defense Bonus
Defense% ê(Df%) = (Dexterity / 4) + Armor Defense% Bonus
Magic Attack   (MAt) = Magic
Magic Defense  (MDf) = Spirit ê-&gt; (BUG..there's NO +Armor MDefense Bonus)
Magic Defense% (MD%) = Armor MDefense% Bonus

 ê|| ê{INF-2} Battle Types &amp; Front/Backrow ê||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

There are several battles that can happen in FF7. The easiest is of course the
Normal Battle, where you face the enemies and they you, no advantages or
disadvantages. This section will describe the battle formations/types other
than normal:

Pre-Emptive: Your characters will have filled time bars at the start of the
-ê battle, and the enemies are with their back towards you, allowing
 êyou to do double damage to them.

Back Attack: Your characters are not facing the enemies, and their back/front
-ê row is reversed (so front row becomes back row and back row
 êbecomes front row). The enemies may attack first and will do
	 êdouble damage if you're not facing them.

Side Attack: Here your party will appear on both sides of the enemies,
-ê surrounding them. The battle with Air Buster is a good example for
 êthis. Back damage hits 2x harder than normal damage.

Side Attack
(Ambush)   : Here the enemies surround you, thus you cannot escape the
-ê battle until you've at least cleared one side up. Back damage does
 ê2 times the damage to you.

Note: A (5-star ONLY) Pre-Emptive Materia will not only give you greater
-ê chances for the Pre-Emptive formation, it can also HALVE the chance of
 êgetting the Ambush and Back Attack special formations. This ONLY works
 êwhen you place the Pre-Emptive Materia on your 3rd character. Whenever
 êyou've changed materia or equipment on a character that doesn't have the
 êPre-Emptive Materia, un- equip/equip the Pre-emptive Materia on your 3rd
 êcharacter again so that the game fixes the check for this bonus.


Front row &amp; Back row:
-ê
It may sometimes be a bit unclear what the difference is between front row and
backrow, but it's actually quite simple. Front row is 'normal'. When characters
are in the backrow, they deal half the damage with physical attacks to enemies,
but also receive half the damage from physical attacks from enemies. The damage
from magic is unaltered.

Enemies can also be in the front or backrow. This, of course, only applies with
groups of enemies. Imagine 3 Shinra Grunts, with one in the back, for example.
A character in your party who is in the back, will do 1/4th damage to the grunt
in the backrow.

To switch a character from the front/backrow, just go to 'Order' in the menu,
select a character, and select it again. Their picture will swap forward or
backward. It's that simple.

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

Unlike several other RPG's, the experience gained from a battle is not split
between party members. If there's 1000 Exp to get, all party members will get
1000 when alive and in your party, for example. These rules generally apply:

Character inside party, not dead: Gains Exp listed at end of the battle
Character inside party, dead: Gains 0 Exp
Character not in party (dead/not dead): Gains half the Exp at end of the battle
Character removed from group (not in PHS/temporary unplayable): Gains 0 Exp

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

There are 31 Status Effects in FF7, some a lot more common than others. They
don't all show on the status screen either. The ones that don't show are:
Dual (Waterpolo), Death Force, Resist, Lucky Girl and Imprisoned. Let's start.

The following section is, (almost) word by word, borrowed from Terence's Battle
Mechanics FAQ. I don't think anything explains it better than he does in there,
so I am not attempting. So, it should be said, credits go to Terence.

Some status effects have a time duration. This is described in time units. The
best way to describe a time unit is to point to a countdown status, such as
Death Sentence or Slow-numb (Slow Petrify). Those countdowns are also measured
in time units, not seconds. If you have the battle speed on 'Wait', you'll
notice that they stop ticking when attacks are being executed. On 'Active', the
timer runs on and on...

Death
-ê
The ultimate offensive Status Attribute.  If you're successfully hit with it,
you are immediately reduced to 0 HP.  Death is also the state of having 0 HP.
You can protect from it, fortunately.  That is, you can protect yourself from
'Sudden Death', which is any attack that causes you to instantly die,
regardless of how much HP you have or how much damage the attack actually
caused.  However, if you are reduced to 0 HP by taking too much damage... well,
you can't protect against that at all.

Near-death
-ê

When your character is heavily wounded, but still able to fight, they are
classed as Near-death.  They kneel down and their HP indicator turns yellow to
notify of this.  Otherwise, this Status Attribute means nothing else; it occurs
only when your HP is 25% or less of your current Max HP, and you are not yet
dead.

Sleep
-ê
This nasty affliction is one of four temporary 'Can't Act' Status Attributes in
FF7.  Once under this Status, the character is asleep, and cannot fight
normally.  However, Sleep is easily reversed; any Physical hit is enough to
wake up a sleeping character.

Poison
-ê
Any character inflicted with this Status will continually take Poison Elemental
damage throughout the battle.  It won't be purged naturally until the battle
ends.

Note: The Status Attribute Poison is different from the Element Poison.  But,
if you Void or Absorb Poison Elemental, any attack that does Poison damage will
no longer inflict the Poison Attribute.  However, you will still be vulnerable
to things like Bad Breath, which causes various Status Attributes without
causing damage.

The reverse also has effects; being Immune to the Status Attribute Poison will
mean that you are also considered Immune to the element.

Visuals: êCharacter kneels/flashes Green

Sadness
-ê
A character inflicted with Sadness is more subdued and careful in battle. They
tend to take less damage from attacks, but they find it difficult to get angry
at anything.  Hence, the growth of their Limit Bar is severely reduced. The
Limit Bar turns blue to notify you of this condition.

Visuals: êLimit bar is colored Blue (instead of pink)
Effects: êCharacter takes approximately 177/256x damage from most attacks
 êexcept Restorative, Items, and attacks with No Random Variation
 êLimit Bar growth halved
Duration: êUntil cured
Protected by: 'Petrify', 'Peerless', 'Resist', Ribbon, Peace Ring
Cured by: êHyper, Esuna, Remedy


Fury
-ê
Anyone in Fury status is more prone to rushing the enemy, and attacking them
with greater fervour.  As such, while they don't benefit from the reduced
damage of Sadness, they instead get an increase in the growth of their Limit
Bar, allowing them to pull off Limit Breaks with greater frequency.  However,
their attacks are more erratic, and miss more often.  The Limit Bar turns red
to notify you of this condition.

Visuals: êLimit bar is colored Red (instead of pink)
Effects: êCharacter Attack% and Magic Attack% reduced by ~30.8%

Cured by: êTranquilizer, Esuna, Remedy


Confusion
-ê	
The pure opposite of Berserk, despite the fact that the character suffering
from Confusion doesn't have any increased damage potential.  You immediately
lose control of the character, and they will randomly attack their allies, even
themselves.  Fortunately, it's easy to cure; a single Physical hit will take
care of it.  However, a recently Confused character will always carry out the
last command they were asked to irregardless; but it will always be against
you.

Silence
-ê
The power of this affliction is often underestimated.  While under its
influence, you are unable to cast any Magic, Enemy Skills or Summons. However,
your other commands are untouched.  Its usefulness lies in using it on the
enemy; many of them have attacks that would be better left sealed with Silence.

Haste
-ê
One of the best Status Attributes, Haste has your time bar filling up twice as
fast as normal.  However, on the flip-side, all timed effects like Slow-numb,
Barrier and so forth, will run out twice as quickly.  But, the pros far
outweigh the cons in this instance.

Slow
-ê
The complete opposite of Haste, Slow causes your time bar to fill up twice as
slow as normal.  But, it has its good side; Barrier, MBarrier, Slow-numb,
Death-sentence... all those take far longer to run out of time.

Stop
-ê
The second worst of the four temporary 'Can't Act' Status Attributes, Stop
completely shuts off the Time counter for that character.  However, on the
other hand, things like Barrier, MBarrier, Regen and so on will not count down
during this time, until Stop has worn off or it's been dispelled.

Frog
-ê
Perhaps the worst of the transformation Statuses, Frog both reduces your attack
power, as well as preventing you from using almost all of your Materia.  The
only options available to you are Fight, Item, and if you have it equipped, the
Magic Spell 'Toad'.  You can't even perform Limit Breaks while transformed into
a frog.

Visuals: êCharacter is a frog!
Effects: êAll Physical attacks do 1/4 of Base Damage
 êCharacter can only use Fight (not Limit), Item (including

Small
-ê
While not as bad as Frog, this is still a terrible condition.  While Magic is
still wide open to you, every physical attack you do will have an Attack of 0;
you will do 1 HP damage until modifications added after the random variation
are added.  Elemental attacks and Added Damage Effects will use the 1 HP damage
as the basis for their calculations.

Slow-numb (Slow Petrify)
-ê
One of the banes of the beginner player, Slow-numb can easily take out a
character within moments if you're not prepared for it.  Essentially, it's a
countdown to petrify; you have 30 units of time (as shown by the counter above
the character's head) to cure them of the affliction, or end the battle.
Otherwise, they are inflicted by the Status Petrify.

Petrify
-ê
Completely turned to stone, this is a very bad Status Attribute to earn.  You
can't act, and even worse, you're flagged as 'Dead'; if everyone in your party
is flagged as 'Dead', then the game is over.  However, it's easily curable, and
while Petrified, you cannot be inflicted with any other Status Attributes, or
take damage in any way at all.  However, that also means you can't have damage
healed while Petrified either. Not many enemies can directly Petrify you. Most
of the time, Slow-numb will be used.

Regen
-ê
An alternative to the standard healing spells, Regen has the potential to be
greater than any of them, for half the cost of Cure3.  However, its healing
ability takes place over time, and it heals at a rate proportional to your
current Max HP value.  In addition, it has a short duration, and it can be
DeSpelled.

Barrier
-ê
A protective Status Attribute, and the first available to you.  It halves the
damage from all Physical attacks, but it has a limited duration.  The time left
for Barrier can be checked in the Barrier gauge in the left window, next to the
character name.

name.

Reflect

One of the most interesting Status Attributes, Reflect allows you to bounce
away certain spells up to a maximum of four times per casting per character. A
list of spells that cannot be reflected can be found below:

Visuals: êNone
Effects: êWill reflect spells up to four times back at caster, or random

Everything else can be reflected, so it's not listed here.


Shield
-ê
A very powerful defensive Status Attribute, second only to Peerless.  It voids
all normal attacks, and absorbs all Elemental Magic.  However, it will not
absorb Non-Elemental damage, and also, Items seem able to breach Shield and
still cause full damage, whether they're Elemental items or not.

Manipulate
-ê

The only Status Attribute that cannot be used on your party, Manipulate is a
very useful tool.  Using it on an enemy, if they're susceptible to it, will
place the enemy under the character's command.  Note that each character can
only Manipulate one enemy at a time, and a single Physical hit will free the
enemy from your control.

Berserk
-ê
This is a very risky Status Attribute.  On the plus side, a character under
this Attribute hits harder than usual with every attack.  But on the minus,
they cannot be controlled, and they randomly attack the enemy any time they
can.  It is also impossible to Critical Strike when under Berserk Status.
Berserk has another use; it's an effective alternative to Silence when used on
the enemy.ê

The ultimate defensive Status Attribute.  Unfortunately, only one character has
the ability to use this: Aeris.  When used, it fully voids all damage of any
type, as well as acting like Resist with regards to Status Attributes. However,
it has a limited duration, and the Void state makes it impossible to heal while
under it, but it is still a formidable Attribute.

Dual
-ê
This extremely rare Status only turns up during one battle; that with
Bottomswell.  Whenever Bottomswell uses Waterpolo at you, both Imprisoned and
Dual are placed on you.  Dual is dangerous however; it acts like a reverse
Regen.  HP is drained over time, requiring swift attention.

Death Force
-ê
A useful status, which allows you to temporarily give yourself protection from
Death until the end of the battle.  Its usefulness stems from the fact that
very few enemies actually use the Death Status.  Recognize them, and you can
possibly spare an Accessory slot or a few Materia slots and just rely on Death
Force for protection when you need it.  Of course, the disadvantage is that the
immunity is temporary; if that character gets hit by DeSpell or White Wind or
gets killed, then they will lose the immunity immediately.

Resist
-ê
You are never given any indication of when you have Resist, but its effects are
quickly apparent; any Status change is prevented by the power of Resist.
Unfortunately, that can also mean, for example, if you have Frog and then
Resist is placed on you, you cannot then cure Frog without removing Resist
first.  Its best use is to trap enemies with certain Status Attributes so that
they can't heal themselves.  As a secondary use, it can be used as a temporary
defense against nasty Statuses, but it's expensive, and not easy to remove.

Lucky Girl
-ê

Only one attack in the game can inflict this Status: Lucky Girl.  This is one
of the Limit Combinations in Cait Sith's Slot Limit.  It is a somewhat useful
status, causing all subsequent attacks to be Critical Strikes.  However, this
is offset by its rarity; most players will go through the game without ever
seeing Lucky Girl.

Imprisoned
-ê

The final temporary 'Can't Act' Status.  Unfortunately, the temporary nature of
this status is dependant on what is causing it; various enemies have a few ways
of dealing out this attribute, and each requires its own method of removing it.
In addition, the character is flagged as 'Dead'.  It is easily the worst of the
four 'Can't Act' Statuses.

This section describes the characters their Limit Breaks briefly, and gives
mostly technical details, rather than descriptions.

Note: When you select a Limit Break, it will come before any other attacks in
the queue (both ally and enemy). It will attack DIRECTLY after the last attack.

-ê.
Learning Limit Breaks: |
-ê'
Limit breaks are learned either by using the first level Limit Break a number
of times, or by killing a certain amount of enemies with that character, which
will learn you the next Limit Level. To be able to teach a Level 4 Limit to a
character, you'll need to have learned all Limit Breaks on that character.

It is possible to 'skip' Limit Breaks. For example, you can get Meteorain
while you haven't learned Climhazzard yet. After all, you could've killed 320
enemies, but not yet have used Blade Beam 7 times yet.

The below chart shows how many times you must use a Limit Break, or how many
kills a character must get in order to reach a new Limit Break. When using
Limit Breaks, you must win the battle in order to have the Limit Count. All
battles in the Battle Square don't count toward wins, nor to kills.

Example: Use Braver 8 times with Cloud, and you will learn Cross-slash. If you
want to learn Blade Beam, you'll need to kill 120 enemies with Cloud. If you
then want to learn Climhazzard, use Blade Beam 7 times. If you want to learn
Meteorain, you'll need to have a total of 320 kills with Cloud, et cetera.

Filling the Limit Bar: |
-ê'
Every character has their own speed of filling their limit break bar, some a lot
faster than others. Below is a table in which you can see how much a character
needs to lose from their max HP to fill up the limit bar completely. For
example, if Cloud has 1000 Max HP, and he's still using Braver/Cross Slash
which are Lvl 1 Limits, then he will need to lose 465 HP to fill up his bar
completely.

 ê|| ê{INF-9} Overflow ê||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

Overflow is basically a glitch that causes negative damage, causing the game to
think that the target has so much HP, it better fix the problem. Instant Death.

Overflow can be attained versus almost all enemies in FF7, with the exceptions
of Ruby Weapon and a Safer Sephiroth at max power. These two enemies have a too
high Defense for the glitch to work.

How does it work? Overflow damage can only be attained by two characters, and
more specifically by only two weapons: Vincent's Death Penalty and Barret's
Missing Score. These two weapons have ridiculous high damage multipliers, which
is the key of access to this glitch. To power up Vincent's Death Penalty, you
need to kill enemies, and the more you kill, the more powerful the weapon.
Barret's Mission Score is powered up by putting as much high AP materia in the
weapon's slots.

The maximum damage multiplier for the Death Penalty is x32, and it's approx.
x25 for the Missing Score. You do not need to have these weapons at max power to
perform overflow, however. It depends on how high the enemy's defense is. The
higher the defense, the more power you need. Emerald Weapon has a Defense of 180
and you'll need quite some power to kill him with Overflow.

As mentioned, you don't need the weapons at max power, but say you need approx
2+ million AP in the Mission Score if you throw 4 Hero Drinks on Barret (to
double his attack power). And you'll need approx 15000+ kills on Vincent's
Death Penalty.

Measuring Vincent's kills may be a useful thing to some players. Here's how you
do it the most easy (and only) way:

o Using Everyone's Grudge:
=ê
If you've only just begun with getting kills on Vincent, you can get Vincent hit
by an attack called Everyone's Grudge, used by Master Tonberry in the Crater.
This attack uses this formula: Kills * 10 = Damage. As you can see, you can only
measure up to 1000 kills with this.

o Using Ruby WEAPON:
=ê
When you get more and more kills, you can check your kills by doing a lot of
math. Do an attack versus Ruby WEAPON. Vincent at Lvl 99, 255 Str, and the
99 Atk Death Penalty will damage Ruby for around 6400 damage. If you do this
damage to Ruby with that Vincent, you'll have around ~12522 kills.

If you're consistently doing 9ê damage to Ruby with the above setup-Vincent,
your kills should be ~20890 or more. That's already enough to kill Emerald with
'Check 2', or in other words with Berserk and Deathblow/Critical Hit.

If you want to measure beyond this, put Vincent under the Frog status before
attacking Ruby Weapon. This will reduce Vincent's damage to 1/4th, so if you
were hitting 9ê before, you will now do 2500 damage (or more, if you had more
kills). At 5000 damage you'll have ~41780 kills.

o Other useful information:
=ê
o If the defense value of an enemy is higher than 421, you can never make the
  overflow trick work, ever. Not even with a maxed out Vincent/Death Penalty.

o The max defense an enemy is allowed to have when you're trying to get
  overflow with a MAXED Barret, is the value 394. This is good enough for
  practically anything but Ruby WEAPON.

o The MINIMUM amount of kills (and here's where it starts to get interesting)
  for Vincent's Death Penalty, in order to One Hit KO Emerald WEAPON [combined
  with 4 Hero Hero Drinks, Berserk, and Deathblow], is 16896 kills.

o The MINIMUM amount of AP for Barret in order to On Hit KO Emerald WEAPON,
  [again combined with 4 Hero Drinks, Berserk, and Deathblow] is 1410ê AP.
  That's not all that bad, seeing how 3 maxed KOTR Materia would do the trick.

o Furthermore, it's impossible to get overflow if you're not using Berserk or
  Deathblow.

This section lists all Magic Green Materia, and also lists the spells that can
be gotten through these Materia. Some notes before heading on:

- The base formula for Base Magic Damage: 6 * [Level + Magic]

  Example 1: Level 50, Magic stat  75..--&gt;6 * [50 ê+  75] =  750 (= Base)
  Example 2: Level 99, Magic stat 255..--&gt;6 * [99 ê+ 255] = 2124 (= Base)

  Damage is then worked out with a spell formula. The formula for this is
  simple: [BaseMagicDamage * SpellPower]. An example:

  If you use Ultima with Example 1, you will do [750 * 6.5625] = 4921 damage.
  If you use Ultima with Example 2, you will do [2124* 6.5625] = 13938 damage.
  This is rough damage; enemy defense still has to be figured in as well.
  Should the damage remain above 9ê after figuring in enemy defense, the
  figure is capped at 9ê.

- If you pair a Magic Green Materia with the All Materia, and you cast a spell
  on all enemies, the damage will be only 2/3 of the original power.

- If you pair a Magic Green Materia with the Quadra Magic Materia, you will
  cast the magic four times with 1/2 power.

opponents. The higher leveled your summon Materia is, the more castings you can
perform of that summon during one battle. Damage is calculated in the same

|- Any valid spell used with Quadra Magic will pick a random target out of the |
| êparty chosen, and attempt to unleash all four castings against that ê|
| êtarget.  If the target dies during the castings, all unused castings are  |
| êlost. êE|
|- Spells that are naturally area will simply hit the chosen party four times. |
|- Each casting will automatically have its damage cut in half; this includes  |
| êHP% and Max HP%-based attacks like Demi and FullCure. MP Cost will be as  |
| êif only a single spell had been cast. ê%|
|- Status effects without a 100% chance of hitting will also have their chance |
| êto hit cut in half. ê7|
|- Attaching multiple Quadra Magic to the same Materia will cause the spell to |
| êhit one extra time per Materia.  For example, having three Quadra Magics  |
| êattached to three Earths would cause Quake to cast 6 times when used. ê|
| êThis can be done up to a maximum of 8 times if you use five (or more) ê|
| êinstances of Quadra Magic. ê0|
|- In the event that the first spell is Reflected, the rest of the Quadra ê|
| êMagic hits will hit the target the spell was successfully reflected to,   |
| êwithout needing to reflect again. ê)|
|- The reason KotR doesn't work with Quadra Magic is NOT because of the MP Cost|
| êbecause Quadra Magic doesn't increase MP Cost. It's not compatible because|
| êit would've been too powerful. ê,|

Common Problems:
-ê
-If you want Trine on all FOUR Enemy Skill Materia's, make sure you don't kill
Godo before getting the Highwind. You can, however, still do everything else in
Wutai, just don't do the Godo Boss Battle.

-Pandora's Box is only used by the first Dragon Zombie you'll meet, as a Final
Attack when it's killed off. After this, something in the game causes them to
NEVER perform this attack again. So, if you want the skill on all FOUR Materia,
learn them all at once, or you will never be able to again.

-Jersey will NEVER cast ?ê if you've already attacked it once (with physical
attacks). This is a bug, so when you get into a battle with them don't attack
them and wait for them to cast ?ê. And even that may take a while.

-Chocobuckle can be learned from ALL Chocobo's, but the easiest way is to find
some that have a level divisible by 4, so you can cast L4 Suicide on it (after
feeding it a Mimett Green OR a Sylkis Green). Around the Chocobo Farm are
Chocobo's with a level that's divisible by 4.

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

The Materia system is well known for its extreme flexibility. There are in
fact almost infinite combinations possible if you have a maximum of 16 slots
available.

Essential for making a Materia Combination are LINKED slots (O=O), which look
sort of like that. Blue Support Materia is also often an essential piece of
Materia, especially for linked slots. With the extremely detailed Materia list
above you should be able to compile your own useful combo's, especially since
it is listed for all Support Materia with which other Materia they function.

Sometimes it matters if you put the combination in your Weapon or in your
Armor. Especially with Added Effect (status effects) and the Elemental Materia.
If you put the combination in your Weapon, you will attack with the particular
element or have a chance to inflict the status effect. Putting the combination
in your armor will protect you completely from the status effect, and depending
on the level of the Elemental Materia, also solid protection vs the element. If
the Elemental Materia is of Lvl3 or higher, you can even put an elemental
combination in your armor, and cast powerful spells of that element (for
example from the Contain Materia) on yourself for solid healing.

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-oO

This section goes over a particular challenge called 'Perfect Game'. While there
are some discrepancies concerning this term, it is nonetheless possible to
define a formal structure, rules and concerns; as such an in-depth section
is warranted.

The challenge will be split up in 'levels', which are by no means official.
Their primary function lies in the possibility for players to choose between
difficulty levels, instead of having to play by strict rules. The following
levels are increasingly challenging.


LEVEL 1:
-ê
- (Able to) complete the game
- Have Yuffie &amp; Vincent
- All characters Lvl 99
- Have All Ultimate Weapons/Ultimate Limit Breaks (Learned!)
- Have a Gold Chocobo
- Have at least 1 of each Materia Mastered, including Master Materia
- This includes 4 Enemy Skill Materia with ALL Skills
- This also includes the Underwater Materia (see below)
- All Side Quests done of section {OPT} (+ anything possibly not in there too)
- *(Being able to) beat Emerald &amp; Ruby

Most of these points speak for themselves. You should be able to beat the game,
meaning you'll need to have beaten the game at least once yourself, without the
help of any others. Since most people get Yuffie and Vincent during the game
anyway, one would almost forget that they're optional characters that should
formally be included in this challenge. Levelling all characters to level 99
isn't hard on it's own, though it might very well be combined with other
criteria, especially the Max Natural HP/MP part, which is explained under
level 4. Having all Ultimate Weapons and having learned all Ultimate Limit
Breaks speaks for itself. Breeding a Gold Chocobo is also fairly straightforward
and can be done with the instructions in the corresponding section. The same
essentially applies to mastering materia. Mastering all four Enemy Skill materia
is an exception. This requires you to wait with defeating Godo until you have
the fourth Enemy Skill Materia, since it's your last chance to learn Trine.
Also be cautious with learning Pandora's Box; be sure to have all Enemy Skill
materia's equipped on a single person during the first time you encounter a
Dragon Zombie in the Northern Crater. Completing all sidequests is fairly
straightforward, although it appears to be in contrast with keeping Emerald
and Ruby alive; see the explanatory note.

Note: It's a requirement that you are able to beat Emerald and Ruby, but it'd
-ê be wise to keep them alive. What good is a perfect party without a perfect
opponent? In other words, you'll want a nice playmate, which Emerald &amp; Ruby
are in every aspect; much more so than a maxed-out Safer Sephiroth. As such,
prove (for yourself) that you can beat them, then leave them be (until you're
ready to really &quot;end&quot; your perfect game, which means little more than having a
truly perfect game).

Mastering the Underwater Materia:
-ê!
The Underwater Materia can actually be mastered, although this is a rather
lengthy and tricky process.  The Underwater Materia can accumulate up to
16777215 AP, after which the counter loops back to 0. However, if you manage to
get *exactly* 16777215 AP on it, the game will display it as mastered.
Unfortunately, since it has no AP master limit programmed into it, the game will
not reward you with a newborn copy. In any case, you'll want to slap the
Underwater Materia in Cloud's Apocalypse (or Cid's Scimitar), which are the
only two weapons in the game with triple materia growth. The best AP training
spot is the swamp area in the Northern Crater; hunt down Magic Pots (give them
Elixirs) and Movers. Be sure to keep track of its AP when you get close to the
maximum of 16777215, then search the world for creatures that give exactly
enough AP to hit the master level.


LEVEL 2:
-ê
- Level 1 requirements
- Max Stats for all characters
- Gotten 'All Treasure' in the game (see definition below)
- All Key Items possible -&gt; check section {LIS-2}
- At least 1 of each item in the game
- Have Max GP (10ê)

In addition to the requirements that apply to level 1, you'll also need to max
out all your characters' stats. This does not include HP and MP, which are
discussed under level 4. You'll also need to collect all possible treasure in
the game, with some unique exceptions. A perfect set of Key Items is also a
requirement. This includes the 'best' combination of Key Items on Wall Market.
A further requirement is to have at least one item in the game (of those
possible to get). For details on this, see section three below.


LEVEL 3:
-ê
- Level 2 requirements
- Have the max for every item in the game (99 in most cases, check {PER-3})
- Have 0 escapes (*)
- Have a 'Perfect Chocobo' (check definition below)
- Max out Barret's Natural HP to 9ê

(*) I've had several people comment on this criterium and some suggested that
 êeither 2ê, 9ê, or 65535 (the absolute maximum) would be more perfect
 êthan zero.  Since you're doing this challenge for yourself and not for me,
 êI'm merely going to sum up the various points of view behind these four
 ênon-arbitrary figures.  You can then decide for yourself which reasoning
 êappeals most to you (or which, perhaps, you think is easiest or hardest to
 êaccomplish).
 ê
 êZero escapes: You have to interpret escapes as a negative event, which is
 ênot all that strange.  Winning a battle is something positive,
 êand perhaps you'd want to max out that figure, but escaping
 êa battle in Final Fantasy VII has a scent of cowardice hanging
 êaround it.  Having zero escapes shows that you've gone to
 êgreat lengths and fought all enemies you encountered.  It also
 êshows that you know the game well: For example, you were
 ênever swept out of battle by the Midgar Zolom (which counts
 êas an escape) - or by any other enemy, for that matter.
 êAnother great advantage of having zero escapes is that it
 êsort of grants you a 'tabula rasa'.  In other words, it allows
 êyou to postpone any answer to the question which amount of
 êescapes is the most perfect - which is ideal in our scenario,
 êsince this is exactly the subject we're discussing.  In still
 êother words, once you have a perfect game for all things
		  considered, escapes excepted, you can always come back to your
		  previous decision to keep it at zero. If you already have
		  several escapes, things get more complicated and tedious.

 ê2ê escapes: The damage that Chocobuckle does is directly linked to your
 êamount of escapes.  In other words, 2ê escapes allows you
 êto instantly trigger Lucky 7's on any character with maximum
 êHP.  This means you have the most powerful attack in the
 êgame available at almost any moment, allowing you to decimate
 ênearly every enemy in the game with just one command.

 ê9ê escapes: It could be argued that in order to max out Chocobuckle
 êitself, one needs to escape 9ê battles.  While it's true
 êthat this maxes out the skill itself (to 9ê damage), it's
 ênot difficult to see that 2ê escapes deals far greater 
 êdamage by its activation of Lucky 7's.

 ê65535 escapes: It could also be argued that every single figure in the game
 ê&quot;needs to be maxed out.&quot;  As explained above, this requires
 êyou to interpret escaping a battle as something &quot;positive&quot;,
 êjust like winning a battle is a positive event.  The amount
 êof escapes will overflow back to zero if you go beyond 65535.
 êI would not advise anyone to choose this interpretation and
 êI have not heard of anyone actually attempting it, but the
 êchoice (and time) is yours.


LEVEL 4:
-ê
- Level 3 requirements
- Max out all characters their natural HP/MP
- Clear the Gold Saucer (check definition below)
- Defeat all 'repeatable' bosses twice (see {AP-4} for this)
- Do everything without the W-Item Trick (you may, however, if you really want
  to, use the trick to get 99 Dragon Fangs, which is impossible otherwise.)

LEVEL 5:
-ê
- Level 4 requirements
- Max out experience and gil
- Max out Vincent's kills for Death Penalty

*Note: I don't think anyone has done this, honestly. It would take at least
-ê 200 hours to max out the kills for Vincent's Death Penalty(65535 kills).
Anyone who attempts this should consider it twice before deciding it's worth it
or not. It is only listed here for completion purposes.

- Score the maximum amount of points at Speed Square
- Get all the prizes at Chocobo Racing at least once, for each level, both by
  betting and by racing yourself
- Save states and turbo controllers are NOT allowed in any of the above

Definition of 'Perfect Chocobo':
-ê 
- Have 176 as Top Speed
- Have 999 Stamina
- Have 100 Co-operation
- Have 100 Intelligence
- Have 100 Acceleration

The only thing that's difficult is the Top Speed. You must breed your Gold
Chocobo with a Wonderful Chocobo until you get two Gold Chocobos of which one
is at least Wonderful. It's difficult to check this. After you've attained that
it's best to keep mating your Gold Chocobos with each other, and mate the
newborns again (which have a chance to be better than their parents, this
chance is the highest when you breed with Zeio Nuts, also check this by feeding
them max greens and check their Max Top Speed). When you get a better newborn
than it's parents were, use it to breed further. You should obviously know that
Parent Chocobo's must wait between 3-10 random battles before they can breed
again, and newborn must wait between 3-18 random battles before they can breed
again.

 ê|| ê{PER-2} Stat Maxing ê||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

This section explains maxing out your character's stats. When a character 
reaches Level 99, they won't even be close to having max stats, so you'll need
to raise them with various sources to the maximum value of 255. There's a
specific source for each of the six primary stats. Below is an overview where to
farm these sources effectively.


Strength: (Power Source)
-ê
- Morph Heavy Tank (Broken Gongaga Reactor)
- Morph Screamer (Mount Nibel)
- Unknown (Sunken Gelnika)

Vitality: (Guard Source)
-ê
- Morph Bagnadrana (Mount Corel)
- Morph Spiral (Mideel Dirt Areas)
- Morph Unknown 2 (Sunken Gelnika)
- Morph Maximum Kimaira (Midgar Raid Disc2, Special Battle Fight #7)
- Morph Armored Golem (Crater)

Magic: (Magic Source)
-ê
- Morph 8 eye (Temple of the Ancients, Battle Square)
- Morph Unknown 3 (Sunken Gelnika, Special Battle Fight #3)

Spirit: (Mind Source)
-ê
- Morph Dragon Rider (Whirlwind Maze)
- Morph Killbin (Whirlwind Maze)
- Morph Serpent (Sunken Gelnika, Battle Square, Special Battle Fight #4)

Dexterity: (Speed Source)
-ê
- Morph Poodler (Sunken Gelnika)

Luck: (Luck Source)
-ê
- Morph Bad Rap (Sunken Gelnika)


*Note: Maxing stats is fairly easy (with sources). There's only one thing to be
-ê aware of: Stat boosting equipment. If you wear something that boosts a
stat, you can't boost that stat higher than 255, BUT it will not be the max for
that character. Say you have a weapon equipped that increases Magic +10, you
can only boost the Magic stat to 255 .. but when you remove the weapon (or
rather, equip an other weapon, since you can't remove weapons), the magic stat
will be only 245 (or higher, depending on the boost the other weapon gives).
Many people don't realize weapons can boost other stats too, mainly Magic. To
reach max stats, un-equip any accessory, equip an armor that doesn't boost any
stats (there's plenty of those armors), and equip a weapon that doesn't boost
any stats, IF POSSIBLE. Otherwise, equip the weapon that has the smallest stat
boost. Here's a quick list of what to equip when boosting stats to the 255 max:

For Cloud equip the Nail Bat.
For Barret equip the Gatling Gun, Drill Arm, Rocket Punch or Pile Banger.
For Tifa equip the Leather Glove, Work Glove, or Master Fist.
For Aeris (doesn't really matter), combination Guard Stick/Mythril Rod.
For RedXIII equip the Magic Comb.
For Yuffie equip the 4-point Shuriken.
For Cait Sith equip the Battle Trumpet.
For Vincent equip the Silver Rifle.
For Cid equip the Mop.


Effective Method:
-ê
For obvious reasons, always use Yuffie with her Conformer. This allows high
damage when morphing. Max her Strength out first so morphing becomes easier.
Speaking of Strength, go to Gongaga for that and have fun with Heavy Tanks.
For Dexterity and Luck, go to the Sunken Gelnika and into the Hallway where you
also (possibly) fought the Turks in. The creatures here come in groups and all
morph into Speed/Luck Sources. As for Vitality, head to Mideel and morph Spiral
creatures on the dirt areas. They also come in groups, so that speed things up.

The two remaining stats, Magic and Spirit, are possibly the hardest to max out.
The best way to do this is to do the Special Battle in the Battle Square, and
only proceed up to the 4th battle all the time. Yes.. because by then you'll
have morphed both the Unknown 3 and Serpent in a Magic/Mind Source. It doesn't
even take THAT long, but it certainly helps if Cloud has max Strength. During
this method, you may also want to morph the Ho-chu's from Fight #2 into Ribbons
to get 99 of those as well.

 ê|| ê{PER-3} Item Maxing ê||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

This section is here to aid you with your goal to attain the Max of every item,
piece of equipment, or whatever is in the Menu under items.
All the difficult or missable items are described in the Walkthrough, and by
following the Walkthrough you will not miss anything.

Below is a list of the whole item menu (and Key Items), and it should look
like this for a Level 3+ Perfect Game:

Note: Limit Breaks should be learned. The only manual you need 99 of is the
Great Gospel limit break manual. This can even be done on Disc 3, BUT keep in
mind you MUST do this BEFORE getting the Gold Armlet from the big box at the
Weapon Trader. After you get the Gold Armlet (which is part of the 'Get ALL
Treasure in the game' definition), you won't be able to trade Mythril for Great
Gospels anymore.

EXTENDED W-ITEM UPDATE:
-êP
The below charts are correct if you don't use the extended W-Item trick to
duplicate most of your items to 99.  If you *do* decide to use the W-Item cheat,
then keep in mind that the following items cannot be duplicated this way:

- Omnislash, Catastrophe, Final Heaven, Great Gospel, Cosmo Memory, Chaos,
  All Creation, Highwind.  (You can still get 99 copies of Great Gospel by doing
  the Mythril trick, and you can get two copies of Cosmo Memory by doing the
  repeating boss trick. You can get 99 copies of All Creation by doing the
  repeating boss trick on Godo. Win the first battle (receive All Creation),
  lose the second, and you'll be able to repeat the trick an infinite amount of
  times.

- Battery
- Save Crystal
- Combat Diary (99 is still possible)
- Autograph (99 is still possible)
- Gambler (99 is still possible)
- Desert Rose
- Earth Harp 
- Buster Sword
- Gatling Gun
- Seraph Comb
- Silver Barette (but you can buy 99 of them)

Guide Books can still be obtained by morphing Ghost Ships and opening the lid of
your Playstation to prevent the game from loading, giving you time to dupe the
item. Otherwise you'll have to get 99 of them legitimately.

The extended W-Item trick works like this:  You'll want to receive an item
during a battle, which can be by stealing an item, morphing an enemy, or by
killing an enemy who has stolen an item from you (such as a Prowler).  Before
you receive this item, you'll want to do the following:

Use up an item that you only have one copy of (a Potion works fine).  The
received item will be placed in the slot of the item you just used up.  Now
select a second item and de-select it. Repeat the selecting and de-selecting
continuously to duplicate the received item.

I do, however, consider the extended W-Item trick a very cheap way of maxing out
your inventory, so it might be worthwhile to split the perfect game challenge
into two: One Perfect Game done without the extended W-Item trick, and one with.
Of course, it's entirely up to you if you even prefer to use the trick at all.

NOTE: While it might seem like a good idea to use this trick in order to max out
 êyour inventory, do realise that it will become increasingly hard to
 êduplicate rare items (such as a Reflect Ring) by having an enemy steal it
 êfrom you.  The chance that they will steal the item you *want* to be
 êstolen is very small.

(*)Note: There are two Dragon Fangs in the game (Win: Schizo, and prize from the
Submarine Game). You can only get 99 with the W-Item trick. There is only one
Escort Guard in the game (Chest: Gelnika), but you can Morph Iron Man (after
the point of no return) into Escort Guards, so it's possible to have more than
one, although useless at that point. 

***Note: As you can see, you can only have 20 Key Items on Disc 3, out of the 64
possible item slots. It's therefore impossible to fill up all Key Item Slots.

 ê|| ê{PER-4} Un-mastered Materia Maxing ê||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*oO

Any Materia can produce an infinite amount of mastered Materia, and 1 new un-
mastered copy will be born during the process. Therefore, only un-mastered
Materia are truly unique. After all, if you ever lose an un-mastered Materia,
you will be seriously screwed if that particular Materia happens to be unique.

Therefore, for a Perfect Game, I will not subscribe you to all sorts of rules in
which you must have so many of this and that mastered Materia. I will focus on
the un-mastered Materia, and in particular on the unique un-mastered Materia.

In short, this requires you to have AT LEAST 1 of each un-mastered Materia, and
more copies of the following special and unique cases:

-êP
3 copies of Un-mastered Elemental Materia
-ê)
The first copy can be gotten from Mayor Domino in the Shinra Building (by
choosing the correct answer on your first attempt). The second copy can be found
in Mount Nibel. The third can be gotten from Tifa's Piano when Tifa is the
leader of the party. Jam on the Piano in the Kalm Flashback.

2 copies of Un-mastered Chocobo Lure Materia
-ê,
You must buy the first one on Disc 1, and get the second one on Disc 2 on the
very bottom right corner of the Chocobo Ranch (outside), near the fence.

2 copies of Un-mastered HP Absorb Materia
-ê)
You can find the first of these at Yuffie's house in Wutai, stored away in a
treasure chest.  The second copy can be found late in the game during your
descent in the Northern Crater.  Consult the walkthrough to easily find both.


Note: The materia listed below are also unique un-mastered copies, but these can
 êonly be gotten by using (in-game) tricks/exploits. If you simply want to
 êgo for a Perfect Game without any compromises, read on. If you're however
 êattempting a Perfect Game without using any sort of exploits, the below
 êcopies don't apply to you.


2 copies of Un-mastered Phoenix Materia
-ê'
After winning the final Fort Condor battle on Disc 2 (or after defeating CMD.
Grand Horn), do *NOT* head outside to pick up the Phoenix Materia. Instead,
leave it alone for the time being and go straight down the ladder (you can still
speak with the old man at the table to get the Huge Materia). Continue with the
game as usual until you reach Disc 3.

On Disc 3, head to Bone Village and search at spot 2 (upper level, to the right
of the ladder) to find the Phoenix Materia (after you've dug up the Buntline
here first). After digging it up, head back to Fort Condor to get the second
unique unmastered copy of Phoenix.

Here is a map with the exact spot (2) to dig at in Bone Village (Disc 3 only):
http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/57001


2 copies of Un-mastered Alexander Materia (keep the 'source' available)
-êG
It's possible to duplicate the unique Alexander Materia by performing a very
specific series of steps, causing Cloud to collapse the very moment you pick
up the materia. This allows you to keep the Alexander Materia in the field so
you can pick it up again. It works because the game first hands you an item, but
only removes it from the field after you confirm the text box telling you that
youve received it. Collapsing at the same time never closes that text box, thus
never removing the item/materia from the field, allowing the duplication trick.

  The trick to duplicating this materia goes as follows (it is vital you do
  exactly what the instructions tell you to - the path Cloud walks is of
  importance indeed. You must only input the directional buttons mentioned;
  if the instructions tell you to run right, you must only hold X and the right
  directional button, for example. The same applies to all instructions.):

  Preliminaries: 1. Find Snow's Cave and defeat her, but do NOT pick up the 
 êAlexander Materia she drops.
 ê2. It helps to equip several (mastered) Enemy Away Materia to
 êreduce/prevent enemies from attacking you while performing
 êthe below trick.

 êField Instructions:
 ê-ê
  1. Walk around in the Great Glacier long enough to make Cloud pass out.
  2. Directly exit the cabin via the shortest route and immediately go back
 êinside. 
  3. Run RIGHT (indeed only the *right* directional button) and save at the Save
 êPoint. Reset the game afterward and load up your savegame.
  4. Back in the cabin after loading, run LEFT. (Yes, Cloud will in fact run up
 êon the screen until he stops; this is normal.) When Cloud stops, run DOWN.
 êCloud will exit the cabin.
  5. Outside, run while holding both R1 + DOWN.
  6. In the large snowfield (where the wind changes the direction of the screen)
 êit doesn't matter how you run exactly, as long as you exit via the far
 ê(initial) right side of the screen so you end up at the right side of the
 êGreat Glacier for our purpose.
  7. When you reach the first snowy path, *WALK* (not run) RIGHT. On the second
 êicy path, again *WALK* RIGHT. Again, on the third rocky path, *WALK* RIGHT.
  8. In the next field, *WALK* RIGHT (yes, just the directional right button) 
 êuntil Cloud stops. At this point, *WALK* by using L1 + RIGHT simultaneously
 êto enter the cave.
  9. Inside, *WALK* DOWN until Cloud stops. At this point, *WALK* by pressing
 êL1 + DOWN until Cloud stops again (indeed, at the cave's right corner.)
 êFrom here, simply *WALK* UP all the way until Cloud stops again.
 10. At this point you'll have to *WALK* DOWN until Cloud stops, then *WALK* UP
 êuntil Cloud stops, and repeat this for a total of ten times. Cloud should
 ênow be standing against the wall, not facing the screen.
 11. Now for the final step: *WALK* DOWN and when Cloud stops, keep holding the
 êDOWN button pressed. Then, while holding that down, add at the exact same
 êtime L1 + CIRCLE. This simultaneously moves Cloud AND picks up the
 êAlexander Materia. You now have a copy of it while the source remains
 êintact.

 [Why do I have to keep the 'source' available - that is, keep the Alexander 
  Materia in the field? The answer is fairly simple. You'll want to collect at
  least two copies of un-mastered Alexander materia to show that you have the
  knowledge (and skill) to pull this trick off, and to show that in theory you
  could repeat it to fill your inventory with as many copies as you'd like.
  Since there are multiple uniquely duplicatable materia, there is no fixed
  amount of materia you should dupe. However, someone could always argue that
  you do indeed need to have a certain specific amount of unmastered copies.
  Because of this, it's wise to simply dupe the materia twice and leave the
  source (the Alexander Materia) in the field, right where it is. That
  way, you can always decide later to dupe more copies as the source is readily
  available to you.]

2 copies of Un-mastered Added Cut Materia (keep the 'source' available)
-êG
  Preliminaries: 1. It helps to equip several (mastered) Enemy Away Materia to
 êreduce/prevent enemies from attacking you while performing
 êthe below trick.

 êField Instructions:
 ê-ê
  1. Walk around in the Great Glacier long enough to make Cloud pass out.
  2. Directly exit the cabin via the shortest route and immediately go back
 êinside (all by running). 
  3. Run RIGHT (indeed only the *right* directional button) and save at the Save
 êPoint. Reset the game afterward and load up your savegame.
  4. Back in the cabin, run UP so Cloud enters the other room.
  5. In this room, run out by holding L1 + LEFT.
  6. In the cabin's first room, run outside by holding L1 + LEFT again.
  7. Outside the cabin, exit the screen by *WALKING*, by holding L1 + LEFT.
  8. In the large snowfield (where the wind changes the direction of the screen)
 êit doesn't matter how you run exactly, as long as you exit via the far
 ê(initial) right side of the screen so you end up at the right side of the
 êGreat Glacier for our purpose.
  9. When you reach the first snowy path, *WALK* RIGHT. On the second icy path,
 êagain *WALK* RIGHT. Again, on the third rocky path, *WALK* RIGHT.
 10. In the next screen (which is outside Snow's Cave) *WALK* by holding R1 +
 êRIGHT until Cloud exits the screen.
 11. At the next two southwest/northeast slopes, *WALK* by holding R1 + DOWN.
 12. At the four-way intersection, *WALK* UP.
 13. You're now at the southeast/northwest slope. *WALK* LEFT.
 14. You've now reached the slope with Added Cut. Run by holding L1 + UP. When
 êCloud stops, run by holding L1 + DOWN to exit the screen.
 15. At the previous slope, run by holding L1 + UP to enter the Added Cut slope
 êagain.
 16. At the Added Cut slope, run by holding L1 + UP.
 17. Now that you're near the Added Cut Materia, simultaneously press LEFT +
 êCIRCLE to pick it up while keeping the source available. (Do NOT press 
 êcircle a second time; you MUST keep the text box available that says you've
 êreceived the Materia.)

 -  2 copies of Un-mastered Shield Materia
 -  2 copies of Un-mastered (Command) Counter Materia
(-) 2 copies of Un-mastered Mega-All Materia

These last three are all obtained through the crater duplication trick.
-êP

The cases above are unique, and therefore you must acquire the maximum amount
possible of the un-mastered copies. You might wonder why the Mega-All Materia is
on the list like (-), which is because it cannot actually be duplicated if you
wish to duplicate a 3rd Mystile by means of the crater duplication trick.  If
you're planning on using the extended W-Item trick (see section {PER-3}, then
you'll want to duplicate the Mega-All Materia as well via the crater duplication
trick.

This results in the following definitive perfect list of unique unmastered 
materia that a perfect inventory should contain:

Let's start off with a definition for this vaguely named challenge. Also, when
you've accomplished this, no one can check if you really did get everything.
It's something for yourself, so that YOU know that YOU did it. And that surely
does give a satisfying feeling, especially when you find many things you didn't
get before.

Definition of 'All Treasure':
-ê
These are items you pick up from chests, item bags, etc. Most of these are in
the field, and if you follow my Walkthrough, you WILL get them all. But this
definition includes more. This also includes the BEST possible treasures when
it comes to things such as the Force Steal from Rufus' Send-off, and 5000 gil
from Parading. And things such as the Megalixir in Bone Village are also
included, because they are a one-time only treasure. The things Esther gives
you for winning 10 times in a row at Chocobo Racing (S-rank) is also included,
for example, and so is the Ribbon for winning the Special Battle 10 times. So
now you should have a decent idea of what is meant with this definition. Things
like the Tough Ring and Reflect Ring (99) are also counted as treasure, since
they're also one-shot items in a way. A good example of something that does NOT
qualify as treasure would be the Sneak Materia, as it can only be gotten at
Chocobo Racing, but there are infinite available copies. So you can qualify for
this definition without having a Sneak Materia, for example. I'm also thinking
of creating a full list for this definition.

This is a full list of all treasure you must get, which will mainly tell you to
just follow the walkthrough and get all treasure in the header's for each
section. It also includes a few treasures that can be easy to miss when you
don't know they actually count as treasure:

o Get all Treasure as described in the Walkthrough headers

o Exception is the Ether during the 'Climbing the Shiny Wire of Hope', where
  you must keep the Battery in your inventory for a Perfect Game. This is a
  dilemma of some sorts, but *intentionally* keeping the Battery warrants
  skipping the Ether. Just because there's no way to check whether or not you
  *intentionally* kept the Battery or not, doesn't mean *you* don't. 

o Another exception is when you normally exchange the Coupons A, B, C for items
  in the Shinra Building. The Coupons are unique, so you should keep them.

o From Bone Village, get the Buntline, Mop, Megalixir, plus anything you may
  have missed. If you somehow manage to dig up a Steal Materia (which is rumored
  to have been found, but this has never been confirmed), I'd appreciate it if
  you could let me know where you found it and in which version.

o All Treasure in the Gold Saucer that can be only gotten once. There are
  various treasures in the Wonder Square, but don't forget about the other
  attractions. You'll need to spend your life away in the Gold Saucer anyway,
  since high scores are one of the requirements for a Perfect Game.

o Do the Crater Trick as described in the Walkthrough, and manage to duplicate
  all relevant materia (Shield, Counter, Mega-All) if you're doing a game with
  the use of the extended W-Item trick.

o As also described in the Walkthrough, get the Elemental Materia from Domino,
  the 5000 gil for Parading, and the Force Stealer from the Send-off.

o Get ALL the Fort Condor Treasure. Good luck, eh?

o You need 99 of the Great Gospel limit break manual. This can even be done on
  Disc 3, but keep in mind you MUST do this BEFORE getting the Gold Armlet from
  the big box at the Weapon Trader. After you get the Gold Armlet (which is also
  a treasure you must get), you won't be able to trade for Great Gospels 
  anymore.

The above might sound tough, but if you follow the walkthrough, most of
treasures can be obtained almost instantly without going out of your way.

These are the things that you REALLY, REALLY can't get anymore after missing
them. In other words, make SURE that you get these things, most of them EVEN if
you're not doing a perfect game.

Note: There's obviously more to miss when you're doing a 100% Treasure Game.
Most items are unique however, and thus of high importance to many players.


1. Iron Bangle: Buy in Sector 7 right away during the first visit.
=ê

2. Ghost Hand: Get them from Ghosts in the Train Graveyard, or from Ghosts in
=ê the Battle Square (battle #3), but only before getting the Tiny
 êBronco. After that it's impossible to get.

3. Battery: Keep this in your inventory.
=ê

4. First Enemy Skill Materia: Pick up after the H0512 boss battle.
=ê

5. Shinra Beta: It's best to steal 99 from these on the Cargo Ship. You CAN,
=ê however, get them from Submarine Crew as well (win), but not
 êenough to fill your inventory fully, as they aren't random
 êencounters.

6. Ifrit Materia: You're D-U-M-B if you miss this, but it's possible. It's left
=ê after the fight with Jenova BIRTH on the Cargo Ship.

7. Ramuh Materia: In the right corner of the Jockey Room, when coming up with
=ê Esther for the Chocobo Races.

8. Vagyrisk Claw: You must steal these from Bagrisks and you can do this as long
=ê as you are Level 77 or LOWER. The best chance for stealing
 êthem is at Level 11, but even then the chance is only 4.23%..
 êWearing a Sneak Glove makes the chance 0% basically, so don't
 êdo that.

9. Added Effect Materia: Get it from the Cave of the Gi.
=ê

10. Yoshiyuki: Gotten by talking to the Old Man in Rocket Town several times.
=ê This can be done UNTIL you get the Submarine. After that, you
 êwon't get it.

11-14. Bahamut Materia/Morph Materia/Luck Plus Materia/Princess Guard:
=êF
 êAll gotten in the Temple of the Ancients. Unequip Aeris her unique Weapon
 êand Armor before Demon's Gate.. Accessory or Materia is fine..

15. MP Absorb Materia: Gotten from the Wutai 'Materia stolen' Subquest. This can
=ê be done UNTIL you parachute into Midgar, so basically it
 êcan't be done on Disc3.

16. Umbrella: Gotten from the Speed Square, Disc1 only (basically).
=ê

17. Mythril Clip: Buy 99 in Junon during Disc1 (basically). After getting the
=ê Highwind this will be gone forever.

18. Shotgun: Buy 99 in Rocket Town during Disc1 (basically). After getting the
=ê Highwind this will be gone forever.

17. Four Slots: Buy 99 in Costa Del Sol during Disc1 (basically). After getting
=ê the Highwind this will be gone forever.

18. Javelin: Chest in Gaea's Cliff ONLY.
=ê

19. Earth Mallet: WIN from Gigas (After Gaea's Cliff/In the Crater). This is
=ê the ONLY place.

20. Gigas Armlet: (Note: it's possible to steal these from Gigas in the Battle
=ê Square, even on Disc3, but it takes much longer)

21-23. Neo Bahamut Materia: All gotten in the Whirlwind Maze
=ê MP Turbo Materia:
 êPoison Ring:

24. Curse Ring: Steal from Ultimate Weapon(1st) and do the Old Beat-up Key Quest
=ê in Mideel before it gets destroyed.

25. Warrior Bangle: Steal from Eagle Gun during the Corel Train events.
=ê

26. Ultima Materia: Don't fail to at least get on the train (and stop it).
=ê

27-29. Battle Trumpet: All gotten from the Underwater Reactor at Junon.
=ê Scimitar:
 êLeviathan Scales:

30-31. Oritsuru: êCan both only be gotten from the Da-chao cave if

=ê

44. Missing Score: On the stairs to Hojo during the Midgar Disc 2 Raid, in a
=ê chest. Barret must be in your party or the chest won't
 êappear.

45. Shinra Alpha: Steal from SOLDIER:1st at the stairs leading to Hojo. This is
=ê the last, but also the best time to get them.

46. Ziedrich: Stolen from Rude (3 times!) on Disc2. 1: Rocket Town, 2: Gelnika,
=ê 3: Midgar.

47. Touph Ring: Stolen from Reno (2 times!) on Disc2. 1: Gelnika, 2: Midgar.
=ê

48. Minerva Band: The one stolen from Elena is unique (Midgar Raid).
=ê

49. Reflect Ring: Steal it from Ultimate Weapon (ground battles) for multiple

BEFORE YOU READ ON, I RECOMMEND YOU READ THE APPENDIX OF THE PARTY MECHANICS
DOCUMENT, ALSO HOSTED AT GAMEFAQS, FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS SECTION.

Take a look at the left table below. Looks nice, huh? Those are the maximum
natural values of HP and MP that your characters can obtain. They don't come
easy, and it will require a lot of resetting in order to get those values.

The table on the right shows the process of MP not being able to be maxed out
simultaneously with HP. The first value shows the maximum natural MP if you
would only max out MP naturally (so technically, it's possible to have). The
value on the right shows the maximum value of natural MP if you also wish to
max natural HP.

The table on the left can be considered your final result, your reward.

The table listed slightly below is a table with Max Safety Levels. These are
the levels that you are allowed to level up to without paying attention to your
character's natural HP or MP. After those levels, you'll have to follow a
certain path in order to max Natural HP/MP.

Note: In order to simplify things, I have chosen to only list the Safety Levels
 êwhen you want to max out BOTH Natural HP and MP. If you only wish to max
 êout one of the two, refer to Terence Party Mechanics.

Technical Note: The tables in Terence's Party Mechanics are not incorrect, but
 êare not much use to us if we want to max out BOTH HP and MP,
 êwhich is exactly the goal of a perfect game. To keep things
 êsimple, a choice had to be made to attain the *absolute*
 ênatural max of either HP or MP (for technical reasons, the game
 êdoesn't allow both to reach the *absolute* value). This choice
 êwas quickly made, and HP will reach its absolute maximum value
 êwhile MP will reach it's maximum natural value that is possible
 êto attain in combination with max natural HP. In other words,
 êHP is deemed more important to MP (for various reasons).

 êCloud êMax Safety Lvl: 66
 êBarret êMax Safety Lvl: 54

I cannot stress enough how important this table is when attempting to Max
Natural HP/MP. You will want to stay low on experience, even in combination with
other goals such as zero escapes, or stealing and winning 99 of certain items.
However, it sounds harder than it is. It's possible to keep two party members
dead in your party, so they won't gain any experience. If you want to continue
your Perfect Game for as long as possible without bothering natural HP/MP, I
suggest you keep Vincent and Cid dead at a few levels below their Safety Lvl.
Why a few below? Because certain story events force you to use other party
members, and members not in your party, even when dead, receive 50% Experience.

I suggest you try to stay in the Safety Level zone at the very least until you
have gotten the Highwind. This grants you a lot of freedom which can provide a
distraction from levelling up and resetting.

Speaking of resetting, you'll be doing so much of it that your Playstation
won't even like it. In some cases you'll be resetting - on average - 64 times
in order to continue to the next level with proper values. This has to do with
a (1/8)*(1/8) = 1/64 chance combination that sometimes pops up in the charts.
Fortunately, the progress is overall less tedious.

Obviously, you should never have any Materia equipped on the character while
you're checking the values, since we're really talking about the *natural* HP/MP
here.

Furthermore, you must make ABSOLUTELY sure that characters don't level up at
the same time, when you're busy with resetting for the right values. I don't
need to explain that your chances will be even more horrible than 1/64 when two
characters level up at the same time.. You'd best avoid that situation.

It goes without saying that it's highly recommended to have multiple save games
that cover various stages of your progress.  It's also important to conveniently
kill your teammates so they gain less experience.

In fact this is the method to prevent characters from getting any experience at
all. Members in your party will get full exp, when dead they get none, and if
they're in the PHS (not in party) they will still gain 1/2 of the normal exp.
Therefore it would be best to keep two party members dead at all times (probably
Red XIII and Vincent).

Of course, it's extremely difficult to max all characters' Max HP/MP.
Alternatively you can just max Barret's HP (to 9ê, which has practical uses),
which is a LOT easier. You could also just max out the HP/MP for your favorite
party members (including Cloud).


Natural Maxing Paths:
=ê
The paths below are, in short, the ones you'll need to follow in order to reach
the maximum natural HP and MP values both: The HP value will reach the absolute
maximum natural value, while the final MP value will be the maximum natural MP
you can reach, given you've maxed out HP to the absolute natural maximum.

Aeris is also included in the charts with the help of Erzfreund. Maxing her HP
and MP to their natural maxima isn't a requirement for a perfect game file
considering obvious reasons, although you could - optionally - max her out and
keep a separate save file as proof you've done a job well done. Her charts are
here for completion purposes only.

My thanks go out to 1whoistornapart for his extensive work on the revision of
these charts.  They wouldn't be here without his aid.


How to make sense of the values:
=ê 
Lastly, how do these charts work? If you are levelling up Cloud for example, and
you're going from Level 83 to Level 84, you'll have to check all values in the
table below. The values that are listed are SAFE. Those are ALLOWED. After the
most recent update of the charts, both HP and MP are integrated in one table,
where HP is always a four-digit number, and MP is always a three-digit number.

You check (in-game) if you have the ALLOWED values for both HP and MP (natural
values of course, without any materia altering them!), and if you do, save your
game. If you don't, reset and try again.  This may in some cases take a lot of
reset. There have been reports of people who were unlucky at on some levels and
had to reset over 100 times. Patience is a virtue in this challenge.

Here's an example with Cloud, who is Level 83 and needs to hit the correct
values at Level 84.  As you can see, the table starts with various HP values.
Then, at the end of the third line, the corresponding MP value range is listed.
This means that if Cloud hits any of the HP values (7826, ..., 7969-7974), then
his MP value is only allowed to be either 793, 794, 795, or 796 (as the range
793-796) indicates.  Three more HP ranges are displayed after this, which
restrict the MP range further.

WARNING!:
=ê	
A final word of warning is in order. As of January 2012, the charts below have
been fully corrected. It might seem paradoxical to say that I don't expect any
errors in the charts below, and at the same time warn people that the charts
might still hold an error. It's still advisable to keep several backup files
available to prevent small disasters.

And now, finally, the charts.

This Enemy Encyclopedia is sorted by area. This means the enemies are sorted in
the order you will meet them. This has various advantages over alphabetical
listing:

- It allows one to search by area.
- Enemies likely to appear together are nearby in the list.
- If you wanted to search/look alphabetically for an enemy, you would have to
  know its name. If you know the name, you can just press Ctrl+F and find the
  enemy you're looking for.

Below is a dummy enemy entry, except somewhat smaller so there is room for
some explanations. Don't worry, most is self-explanatory.

Also, attacks will look like this:

[Attack Name, 1 or All Targets, Elemental (if none, no mention),
Base Damage (this will be reduced by your defense, so the damage in-game will
be lower), Inflicts Status Effects (if none, no mention - hit chance is either
100% or in brackets. When in brackets, think of it as a chance out of 64, yes,
even if the number exceeds it - then it's simply 100%. These formulas are not
known yet precisely), Notes (is the attack used under certain circumstances,
Final Attack, and so on)]

Battle Notes explain information about the specific enemy battle and are always
self explanatory.

NOTE: If you successfully steal an item from an enemy, that enemy will NEVER
 êdrop an item. You can't have both a stolen and dropped item.

Example of Dropped List:
=ê
Win:  Tranquilizer [8],
 êHi-Potion [8],
 êLoco Weed [8]

- The odds in brackets should be thought of as fractions out of 64 (plus 1).
- So there is a 9/64 chance of winning Tranquilizer.
  - 55/64 chance something else:
 ê- 9/64 chance of Hi-Potion
 ê- 55/64 chance something else
 ê-  9/64 chance of Loco Weed
 ê- 55/64 chance of Nothing

 êThis gives you the following chances:

 êTranquilizer: (9/64) ê= 14.06%
 êHi-Potion: (55/64)*(9/64) ê	= 12.08%
 êLoco Weed: (55/64)*(55/64)*(9/64) = 10.39%
 êNothing: (55/64)*(55/64)*(55/64)  = 63.47%

Note that this is a complicated and one of the rarer cases. Most of the time, an
enemy can only drop one item, and it's a simple 9/64 (or whatever) chance when
it says [8] (or [32] or whatever). If it says 100% it should be obvious as well.


Example of Stealing List:
=ê
Steal: Soft [32],
 êSoft [32],
 êVagyrisk Claw [8]

This is more formula heavy, I'm sorry, but it just is.

Factor êLvl Diff = 40 + Attacker's Level - Target's Level
Formula's: êStealMod = [512 * Lvl Diff / 100]

Main Formula: êChance   = [Item Chance * StealMod / 256]

The number you get out of the Chance formula is to be thought of as a fraction
out of 64 (plus 1), so from here it's the same as dropped items.

Example: This is from a Bagrisk, a creature that is Level 19. Assuming you are
-ê level 77, let's see how the game checks the Stealing List:

Lvl Diff ê= 40 + 77 - 19 = 98
Stealmod ê= [512 * 98/100] = [501.76] = 501
Chance (Soft) ê
= [32 * 501/256] = [62.625] = 62
Chance (Vagyrisk Claw) = [8 * 501/256] = [15.656] = 15

 ê((Chance + 1)/64)

 ê1st Soft: (63/64) ê=  98.44%
 ê2nd Soft: (1/64)*(63/64) ê=   1.54%
 êVagyrisk Claw: (1/64)*(1/64)*(16/64) = 0.0061%
 êNothing: (1/64)*(1/64)*(48/64) ê=  0.018%

As you can see, even though Level 77 is the last possible level to steal a
Vagyrisk Claw at, it's not quite a good idea to wait that long, seeing how low
your chances are. At Level 78+, the chance of stealing a Vagyrisk Claw is 0.
At Level 11, the chances for stealing are best, with a 54.86% chance of stealing
a Soft, a 4.23% chance of stealing a Vagyrisk Claw, and a 40.91% chance of
stealing Nothing. For the mechanics, my thanks go out to Terence.

Most of the time, an enemy will have only one item to steal. In that case, it's
a lot easier as you only have to calculate the chance for that one item.

And now, on to the enemy list.

| -ê ê@|
| - Guard Scorpion has two forms. It's initial is when the battle starts, this |
|   is Form 1. It's second form is when it raises it's tail. ê|
| - It will transform to Form 2 after using two damaging attacks. It will ê|
|   transform back to Form 1 after a short amount of time has passed. ê
|
| - During Form 1, the stats for Def and MDef above are correct. When it is ê|
|   in it's 2nd Form, it will get a boost for these stats, and these stats ê|
|   become this: Defense = 255, MDefense = 384. ê |
| - Guard Scorpion has a fixed attack pattern: Search Scope, Attack, Search ê|
 êScope, Attack, Transform to Form 2, Wait, Wait, Transform to Form 1, Repeat|

| - There are a LOT of variables which choose the one you fight: ê|
| - If there are less than 3 party members in your party: L19 CMD.Grand Horn.  |
| - For the following notes, please note that Aeris Lvl NEVER counts to the ê|
|   party's average Lvl for this minigame, how strange it might be. A party ê|
|   with L20 Aeris, L25 Cloud and L25 RedXIII results in an average of ê	|

| - Average Party Level = 18 or lower: L19 CMD.Grand Horn. ê|
| - Average Party Level 25+: L25 CMD.Grand Horn. ê|
| - The last Fort Condor battle (the only mandatory one), you will always face |
|   the L37 CMD.Grand Horn. This is also the only time you face the L37 one.   |

|   from his initial 10ê HP. The random battles later allow you to reduce   |
|   his HP even more. When it falls below 20ê HP, Ultimate Weapon will head  |
|   over to Cosmo Canyon, where the final battle with it is initiated. If you  |
|   reduced it's HP to 0, it will be restored to 20ê in this final battle.   |
| - In the first battle, you can steal a Curse Ring, in any other ground ê|
|   battles you can steal a Reflect Ring, and in any other aerial battles you  |
|   can steal a Circlet. ê7|

| Battle Notes: - Example: If one party member is dead, and the other two their|
| -ê   current HP combined is 5500, then the average party HP is ê|
| 2750. If Serpent's HP is higher than ~80% of that, so at 2200+ HP, it will   |
| only be able to use Viper Breath. If between 1100 and 2200 HP, it will be ê|
| only able to use Aqualung. Between 550 and 1100 HP it will only be able to   |
| use Huge Tidal Wave, and below 550 HP it can only use Dragon Dance in this   |
| example. As you can see, the most used attack is Viper Breath due to Serpent |
| often having higher HP than your party's average HP. ê|

| - All parts have the same basic stats as Bizarro*Sephiroth. ê|
| - Right Magic Absorbs Ice and Lightning, Left Magic Absorbs Fire and Ice. ê|
| - Core is immune to ALL damage, unless both Right and Left Magic are dead.   |
| - Wether you face Bizarro Sephiroth with one, two, or three parties, depends |
|   on the following checks: ê3|
| - If ANY one statement of the following is true, then: ê|
| êN|
| - One Party: 1. Jenova Synthesis achieved 13+ turns before the countdown for |
| êUltima started. ê.|
| ê2. The average party level is 53 or less, Aeris not counting.   |
| ê3. At least one character is level 34 or less. ê|
| êN|
| - Two Parties: 1. At least one party member is level 44 or less. ê|
| ê2. You are missing Yuffie, Vincent, or both. ê|
| ê3. The average party level is 67 or less. ê|
| êN|
| - Three Parties: Basically, fail the above checks, and you get 3 parties. In |
| êother words, it means ALL the following is true: ê|
| ê1. Jenova*SYNTHESIS got a max of 12 turns before countdown. |
| ê2. The average party level is 68+. ê|
| ê3. The lowest level a character has is 45+. ê|
| ê4. Both Yuffie and Vincent are recruited. ê|
| êN|
| - The Def, MDef and Dex stats of all the different Bizarro Sephiroth's that  |
|   you can battle vary slightly, give or take 20 points. For the *exact* ê|
|   mechanics, I refer you to the Enemy Mechanics guide by TFergusson. I would |
|   be going out of my way if I went into too many details here, as the whole  |

The following encounter lists can come in handy if you want to know the
encounter rates and chances for encountering certain enemies.

Encounter Rates show how 'dangerous' a specific area is. The LOWER the rate, the
more often you will find yourself running into encounters.

How often you will get into a Chocobo Battle depends on the level of your
Chocobo Lure Materia.

You can only catch Chocobo's on the World Map at Chocobo Tracks, and you MUST
have a Chocobo Lure Materia equipped. A Level 1 Chocobo Lure Materia gives a
'Lure Rating' of 8. L2 gives a rating of 12, and a L3&amp;L4 give a rating of 16.
The maximum rating you can get by stacking Chocobo Lure materia is 32. You can
get this with two L3 or higher Chocobo Lure Materia. With a rating of 32, you
will get 100% Chocobo encounters on Chocobo Tracks. To compare, a rating of 16
would give you 100% around the Chocobo Ranch &amp; Junon, and only 50% everywhere
else. A rating of only 8 would give you 75% around the Ranch, 50% around Junon,
and only 25% everywhere else.

A table can help illustrate this further:
.-ê.-ê.-ê.-ê.-ê.

When you get into a Chocobo Battle, which encounter you get depends on odds.
Also note, Chocobo Level doesn't have anything to do with how good the Chocobo
is. The battle formation is what matters when looking at how good they are.

Squaresoft never released these tracks - used in the official trailer back in
1998 - on any of their official releases. However, these tracks can be found an
official album that contains various themes:

The Hollywood Series - Dangerous Games

&quot;A distinctive collection of themes, promos and commercials written in
contemporary cinematic styles. The CD was recorded with the London Symphony
Orchestra augmented by contemporary instrumentation.&quot;

This learns that the track was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra (not
the least of orchestra's!), and that all versions of the track were composed by
Steve Baker (and not Nobuo Uematsu, who composed all other tracks of the game).

All Lucky 7s:
-ê
Whenever a character gets 7ê HP, he/she will go on a rampage of 64 hits, that
all do 7ê damage a hit. That adds up to 482174 total damage. Plus, the
character will do 7ê damage for all other hits he makes (after the
rampage, should the enemy still live).

There are many ways for getting All Lucky 7s on your characters. You can fool
around by keeping your enemies quiet (manipulate them), and have one of your
characters in mini attack your characters until the last digits are 77. Exit
the battle and heal until you're at 7ê HP. You can also try and train
Chocobuckle up to 2ê (or 1ê) damage to get an instant All Lucky 7s.. but it
will require you 2ê escapes from battles..

It should be noted that after the battle, the character's HP is reduced to 1,
so you can't bring the Lucky 7s over to another battle. Furthermore, it must
be said that even when 2 (or all) characters get into Lucky 7s, the amount of
total hits stays the same (64 hits in total). All characters will get reduced
to 1 HP after the battle this way.

Perhaps more interestingly, enemies can ALSO go into All Lucky 7s. Of course,
this means bad news for you, since they'll hit for 7ê every time they hit. The
good news is that they don't go in a frenzy; It's just that their attacks cause
7ê damage all the time. Other good news is that if you poison them, the
poison effect will also cause 7ê damage, meaning instant death. Obviously,
the enemy must have above 7ê HP to even get into All Lucky 7s. There aren't
that many enemies that have that high HP, although there's plenty of bosses
that qualify.

You may wonder.. why exactly 64 hits? I wondered the same thing. The only thing
I can come up with is that Square didn't want the frenzy to last forever (so
you can't kill Emerald and Ruby with it in one go, probably), and capped the
damage at 500k damage, a nice round number. Since you can't get exactly 50ê
damage with All Lucky 7s, it comes down to 64 hits, with 497728 damage in
total. Another possibility is that the combo couldn't be coded longer than 64
consecutive hits. 64 is a common hexidecimal number, so it's a possibility.

W-Item Trick:
-ê
With the W-Item Materia, you can duplicate any item that can be USED IN BATTLE.
This excludes a lot of things, like equipment. It works like this: Say you want
to duplicate a Megalixir, of which you only have 1 left. Select the W-Item
Command, then select the Megalixir and use it. Then move your cursor to any
other item the you can use, and press O. After this, press X. You'll now have
2 Megalixirs. Press O,X,O,X..etc to get more duplicates. And yes, you only need
to have 1 of an item and you can duplicate it.

Quadra Magic Materia with the Highwind:
-ê(
The first materia cave you can visit is the one that's located on an island
northeast of Mideel. It's an island with a green part and a rocky gray part.
The parts are separated by a small cliff. Normally this cave can be reached by
the Green, Black, and Gold Chocobo's. I say normally, because there is a trick
that you can perform with the Highwind, so that you land on the rocky part of
the island, thus gaining access to the materia cave. The trick can be, well,
tricky to do, but once you get it you'll see that it's not impossible to pull
off. This is how you do the trick:

Fly with the Highwind to the east of the Chocobo Ranch and spot the Cave.
Follow the dirt path from the cave until you see a cliff that leads to a grass
area. This is the spot you need to be at. The trick is to fly/land the Highwind
near the cliff so that when you land, you'll actually be on the dirt area
leading to the Cave that's normally still unreachable. To do this, face the
Highwind south, and use Square + Directional buttons to move it around. When
nearby the ledge, press X to land, and also hold the Up/Left buttons along with
L1. If done correctly, you'll be next to the ledge on the dirt area. It's kinda
tricky, but give it a few tries and I'm sure you'll be able to pull it off.

Here's a video that shows how it's done: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vhDDj_b1hek

Regain Chocobo Stamina:
-ê
During Chocobo Racing, hold R1+R2 down to regain Stamina.

The Slots Trick:
-ê
A good way to choose what handicap you'll get is to manipulate the spinning
slot machine by tapping square quickly, which basically slows the slots down.
There are always three handicaps on a slot (sometimes it's 3 the same though).
If the slots are, for example, a Frog, 5 Lvl Down, and Green Materia, and you
want the 5 Lvl Down handicap, tap square like I described previously, and press
circle the moment the Frog picture passes the middle of the slot. It will spin
to the next icon and halt there, because it takes a bit to press the button and
for the game to confirm. Don't forget, practice makes perfect.

Note that this trick also works for Tifa's Slots, and Cait Sith's Slots. With
Cait it's still extremely difficult to get 3 Cait Sith's on a row, though.

Escape Battle Square and get BP:
-ê!
If things get really rough, you CAN use a Smoke Bomb item to escape, and STILL
receive all the BP, including the handicap for that battle! Same thing works
for the 'Escape' spell on the Exit Materia. Please note that if you escape
normally, you *will* lose all your BP.

Crater Duplication Trick:
-ê

o Perfect Game Without extended W-Item trick:
  =ê+
  - This requires you to get a duplicate of the Mystile, Imperial Guard,
 êthe Shield Materia and the (Command) Counter Materia. The following
 êinstructions yield this result:

 êCloud: Left/Down
 êBarret: Left/Up
 êTifa: Right
 êRed XIII: Left/Up
 êCait Sith: Left/Down
 êYuffie: Left/Up
 êVincent: Left/Down
 êCid: Left/Up
 ê
  - Now take Cloud down through the lowest path on the screen.


o Perfect Game WITH extended W-Item trick:
  =ê(
  - This does NOT require you to get duplicates of the Mystile and Imperial
 êGuard, since you can duplicate these with the extended W-Item trick.
 êAs such, you'll need duplicates of the Shield Materia, the (Command) Counter
 êMateria, AND the Mega All Materia. There are specific instructions to do
 êthis, which differ from the above.

  - The reason why the instructions for this combination of treasure are
 êdifferent is because once you send Cloud down the right path (which we are
 êrequired to do in this scenario), all party members who are sent down the
 êleft path have a 50/50 chance to give one of the two possible items they
 êcan give you. This means you could either try several times and get lucky,
 ê(the chance is 12.5%) or carefully follow the instructions below:

  - First of all, send Cloud right, and send Red XIII, Yuffie, and Vincent
 êleft.  It doesn't matter which way you send any other party members.
  
  - Head down to the bottom of the crater (where the paths intersect). Don't
 êmeet up with the rest of the gang; instead, backtrack through the 2 o'clock
 êexit and collect all items on both unexplored paths (including Mega-All,
 êShield, and Counter).
 ê
  - Head back to the Highwind after this. Save your game, and do a hard reset.
 êNow load your game and head back to the crater.
 ê
  - This part is slightly more tricky. When you pass through the spiral descent
 êfield (the one where you found the Save Crystal) make sure you RUN with
 êCloud (don't walk), don't get stuck, don't stop to open chests, and don't
 êtake the longest route (in other words, don't hug the wall and get down
 êASAP). [All of this is necessary to get a specific &quot;random&quot; result.]
 ê
  - At the field where your party initially split, take the RIGHT path.
  
  - At the bottom of the crater (where the paths merge), do the following:
 êEnter and instantly exit the 2 o'clock path SIX times.
 ê
  - That's it! You can now meet up with your teammates at the rendez-vous.
 êThe items you receive should be:
 ê
 êBarret: Remedy
 êTifa: Hero Drink
 êRed XIII: Shield Materia
 êYuffie: Counter Materia
 êCait Sith: Remedy
 êVincent: Mega-All Materia
 êCid: Elixir

Lastly, below is a list with the items that each character will normally grab
when sent down a specific path.

The Right Path:
-ê
Barret: êGuard Source
Tifa: êMythril (Mystile)
Red XIII:  Mind Source
Yuffie: êLast Elixir (Megalixir)
Cait Sith: Elixir
Vincent:   Last Elixir (Megalixir)
Cid: êSpeed Source

The Left-Upper Path:
-ê
Barret: êVaccine
Tifa: êHero Drink
Red XIII:  Shield materia
Yuffie: ê(Command) Counter materia
Cait Sith: Remedy
Vincent:   Magic Source
Cid: êImperial Guard

The Left-Down Path:
-ê
Barret: êRemedy
Tifa: êTurbo Ether
Red XIII:  Speed Source
Yuffie: êVaccine
Cait Sith: X-Potion
Vincent:   Mega-All materia
Cid: êElixir

Note: If Cloud goes *right*, then any party members going left have a 50/50
 êchance to give either the left-up or the left-down path's item.


The Repeating Boss Glitch:
-ê
There is a way to fight almost any boss on *field* maps twice (so Diamond,
Emerald and Ruby Weapon are excluded, as are the battles with Ultimate Weapon
on the World Map).  This trick can be useful since it allows you to get the
battle spoils two times.  While almost all battle spoils can be duplicated
regularly with the (extended) W-Item duplication trick, there are two exceptions
to this rule.  These are:

1. Cosmo Memory (Red XIII's L4 Limit Break Manual). Dropped by Lost Number.
   You can get one extra copy of this item.

2. All Creation (Yuffie's L4 Limit Break Manual). Dropped by Godo.
   You can get 99 copies of this item by winning the first battle and losing the
   second. Repeat this until you have All Creation maxed out. Note that you'll
   need to have Yuffie learn the limit break as well during the process,
   otherwise you'll be missing one copy and end up with 98 All Creations.

Of course, you might want to duplicate the battle spoils of other bosses, so
here's a list for your consideration:

 ê	* Denotes unique and normally non-duplicatable items.

 ê	Note: I have not yet field-tested whether or not it's possible
 êto fight Emerald and Ruby twice, but presumably it is.

The glitch builds on another glitch, namely the 'skip a random battle by
opening the menu exactly at the split second the game wanted to give you a
random battle'.  Never heard of that one?  Well, it's just as it says: If you
open the menu when the game was supposed to give you a random battle, it'll
skip this battle.

If you save your game and enter any field map by a fixed route, you'll get a
random encounter at some point.  If you reload this save game and walk down the
exact route, you'll notice (especially after a few reloads) that the battle
occurs at the exact same spot.  This is because the random battle system is
only semi-random in FFVII.  In any case, since you now know when to open the
menu in order to skip the battle, reload your save game and do so.  If done
correctly, the battle will be skipped.  You'll know it was skipped because when
you proceed through the field, the battle won't occur on that very spot.

That's good and all, but it doesn't really do anything special, or does it?
It does, actually.  The next non-random encounter (usually a Boss Battle) will
be fought twice if no other battles occurred since the one you skipped.  This
means you can fight boss battles twice and get their spoils twice as well.

Note: It's possible that the game's music will goof up during the second battle,
 êand freezes might also occur.  If you want that extra loot, you'll have
 êto work for it!

Note: This glitch also sheds light on the numerous reports over the years (some
 êof which probably go back as far as 1998) in which people claimed to have
 êfought a certain boss twice, and as such got double the battle spoils.
 êMost of them were legitimate reports, although back then, no one actually
 êknew what was causing this and as such it couldn't be duplicated on
 êdemand back then.


The Save Crystal Glitch
-ê
This glitch allows you to use the Save Crystal in the Northern Crater one time,
creating a Save Point at a very specific screen while keeping the actual Save
Crystal item in your inventory. This allows you to either keep the Save Crystal
(for the purpose of a Perfect Game) or to create a second Save Point anywhere
you wish in the Northern Crater.

The trick is done in the third screen of the Left-Down path of the Northern
Crater, and requires that you HAVEN'T picked up the X-Potion from the chest
there just yet. What you need to do is move close to the ledge of the first
chest (which contains the X-Potion). This allows you to jump down and open the
chest the split second Cloud starts jumping down. Do NOT close the message that
you've received an X-Potion. This message - if you've done the above correctly -
will not paralyse Cloud, allowing you to move close to the exit of the screen
down below. Do NOT exit the screen, but position Cloud in such a way that his
face is off the screen, but without actually exiting the area.

Enter the menu and use the Save Crystal in your menu. When the game asks you
(in the field) if you want to create a Save Point here, answer yet and
IMMEDIATELY run off the screen to the left. In the next screen (the bottom of
the Northern Crater), the game should ask you again whether or not you want to
create a Save Point here. Answer 'no' and return to the previous screen. If done
correctly, you've now created a Save Point and still have the Save Crystal in
your inventory.

This section will discuss which Character Team, which Armor and Accessory setups
are the absolute best.


{AP-5.1} The Best Team
-ê
A very difficult matter to discuss. The easiest character to put in here is..
Cloud. Simply because you don't have a choice for the majority of the game, he
will be in your party. Fortunately, he is also one of the best characters in
the game. This leaves us with the remaining two characters.

The choice will be made by technical power and theoretically being able to
perform as much possible damage in as little time.

This leaves out Red XIII. While he's absolutely the best character to use from
when you get him up to the middle of Disc 2 (basically a large part of the game)
he doesn't qualify for the 'Best Team'. He lacks good multiple hit Limit Breaks
and aside from Stardust Ray (10 hits), there's only Earth Rave with 5 hits.
Stardust Ray is only 10 hits, and is quite weak (5/8 of base power). There are
characters with better Limit Breaks. Red's Cosmo Memory only hits once.

Aeris has obviously some great, unique limit breaks that can make the whole
party invincible for a short time (the great status effect Peerless). But
unfortunately, for even more obvious reasons, Aeris is not suited for the 'Best
Team'.

Tifa also has a few problems that interfere with her fitting in the 'Best Team'
because her limits only hit once. Sure, there's 7 of them total, but that is
still only 7 hits. And the damage cap stays 9ê. Besides, Tifa has a horrible
Ultimate Weapon, which is worthless when her Limit Bar is not, or barely
filled.

Vincent then? His limits transform him into beasts, and these transformations
give him huge boosts to his stats. However, you lose control of Vincent for the
remainder of the battle. Should you choose to use Vincent, it would be best to
have him transform into Hellmasker. You'll have 70% chance that every time he
uses an attack, it will be Splattercombo, which hits 5 times. Besides, this
transformation gives +50% evasion, a boost that cannot be replicated by the
use of skills or items. Still, losing control over Vincent is a very painful
issue when you are fighting Emerald, Ruby, or perhaps Safer Sephiroth at max
power. I would almost write Vincent off the list, if it weren't for his quite
'odd' Ultimate Weapon. The Death Penalty increases in damage by killing enemies
but this allows for 'Overflow damage'. This can kill any enemy, even Emerald
Weapon, in one hit. Only Ruby Weapon can withstand the overflow damage, due
to it's insane defense. Obviously, Overflow Damage is nice, but it is also
considered a glitch. All in all, this will take a very long time to power up
anyway, and therefore I'm throwing Vincent out of the race.

How about Cait Sith? His Ultimate Weapon uses the same powers as Cloud's, but
his limit break makes him unique. He can kill anything in one hit with the
right slots combo, but if you were to rely on pure luck, you can count on
never seeing that happen. Manipulating the slots sometimes works, but often it
doesn't, because of the game playing 'tricks' on the slots. It will let it spin
too far. This just isn't reliable enough, so Cait's out of the race too.

Leaves us with Barret, Cid, and Yuffie. An extremely difficult choice.
Barret has the Ungarmax limit break (18 hits, at 1/2 of base power).
Cid has the Highwind limit break (18 hits, at 11/16 of base power), which is
technically speaking the greatest in damage potential.
Yuffie has the Doom of the Living limit break (15 hits, at 5/8 of base power).

Judging by limits, this puts Cid on front, Barret a close second, and Yuffie a
slightly distant 3rd. However, we're not done on judging the limits yet.
Terence has uncovered how fast limit breaks charge. Here's how fast the limits
charge that we are discussing right now:

Doom of the Living: 132.8%
Highwind: ê159.3%
Ungarmax: ê124.2%

The percentage represent how much of the Max HP a character needs to take
damage, in order for the Limit Bar to completely fill up. Say a character has
9ê max HP, then Ungarmax's Limit Bar will be filled up after Barret has taken
12420 damage. This changes the whole issue. It looks like Barret now takes the
first place, seeing how his limit charges up absolutely the fastest. Yuffie
closes in on Cid, because her bar also charges up faster than Cid's. And on
another note, Barret's limit also has by far the fastest animation, which gives
him another advantage in my opinion. So far the limit breaks. Let's continue!

Barret's Ultimate Weapon is good. In fact, in can also cause overflow damage,
just like Vincent, if you fill it up with Mastered KotR Materia. However,
because that's an abnormal setup, I will not look at this factor. Aside of that
the weapon can easily max out damage.

Yuffie's Ultimate Weapon is the best of the game, however. Her Conformer will
adjust in power to the enemy level. Is the enemy level 99? The power will be
max. In other words, when you need the power, you will have it. When you don't
need the power, you have less. Not only that, but the Conformer can morph at
full power. This is an excellent ability. Last but not least, should Yuffie get
confused and attack one of your party members, the Conformer will deal no
damage at all, to your character. Another great ability.

Cid's Ultimate Weapon, the Venus Gospel, is also good. Easily maxes damage, but
when Cid's really low on MP, you will see a drop in damage, which isn't so
nice. All in all, a decent weapon.

Noteworthy at the very least, both Barret and Yuffie's Ultimate Weapons are
Long Range. This means you can always have them in the back while doing full
damage, and only receiving half the (physical) damage the enemy dishes out.

Lastly, Barret can max out his 'Natural HP' (also see section {PER-7} ). This
means he can have 9ê HP without wasting a materia slot on a HP Plus Materia.
This, of course, requires a precise setup so there's no materia that will lower
his HP, but it can save you a materia slot. Another + for Barret.

MY CONCLUSION: Barret belongs into 'The Best Team', no discussion. However,
-ê it's a difficult call between Yuffie and Cid. I would go with
 êYuffie, simple because her Ultimate Weapon is so much better,
 êand her limit break also fills up faster.

HOWEVER..
-ê	
Remember, this is all theory. Feel free to use whoever you like. It will never
really matter who you use, when you're already very powerful. This is just an
analysis of a discussion that has been held numerous times.


 ê.-ê'.
 ê| {AP-5.2} The Best Armor and Accessory |
 ê'-ê''

This is a shorter discussion, that's for sure. The nominated armors are:

- Ziedrich, Mystile, Wizard Bracelet.

Aren't we narrowing the list down too much already?  Perhaps, but remember that
FFVII has a bug that causes Armor Magic Defense (MDef) to be zero for all types
of armor, no matter what their statistics say.  Fortunately, MDef% (Magic
Evasion) does work, as does everything else.

One of the runner-ups would be Aegis Armlet, which has good stats but only four
slots, which is rather meager.  Both Escort Guard and Minerva Band have nice
elemental properties and six slots, but their evasion stats (Def% and MDef%)
are poor.  The same can be said about Imperial Guard.

Ziedrich is obviously a powerhouse armor, and Rude is one lucky guy that Shinra
keeps supplying him with these. (&quot;Sorry boss.. Cloud &amp; Co. stole the previous..
again.&quot;) Its biggest flaw is the complete lack of Materia slots.  The armor
does make it up with its max defense and decent evasion stats.  If one is 
scared of Emerald WEAPON's Aire Tam Storm attack (which does 1ê damage per
equipped Materia), it's a decent alternative. Besides, the Ziedrich adds +20
to both Strength and Magic.  As a bonus, it also halves ALL elemental attacks,
including rare 'invisible' elements such as Cut and Shout..

The Wizard Bracelet would be rather good if it weren't for the Mdef bug. Still,
it's the only armor in the game with 8 slots-linked. This alone makes it very
good. It's defense stats are worthless, but then again, isn't offense the best
defense anyway?

The undisputed all-round winner is the Mystile.  It has six linked slots, solid
defense and amazing evasion stats (50% for physical, and 60% for magical
attacks).  Many enemy attacks will simply be evaded, something rather handy
when they're hard-hitting claw swipes from something like Ruby WEAPON, but
equally useful in any other situation.

CONCLUSION: Mystile
-ê

Then Accessories. Highly a matter of preference, there are a few that are
clearly better than the rest. The nominated ones: Ribbon, Sprint Shoes,
Protect Ring, and Sneak Glove.

It's clear that Ribbon protects against nearly all bad status effects. It
doesn't protect against Slow and Death however.

Sprint Shoes will give you Auto-Haste at the start of the battle. This could
speed battles up for you and make them easier considering Haste allows you to
attack rapidly.

Protect Ring gives an Auto-Wall at the start of the battle. All damage cut in
half.. that's quite nice. The effects wear off quickly though, so for lengthy
battles it's hardly useful.

The Sneak Glove allows you to steal items a lot faster than normal. A unique
ability, hard to weigh against the others. Plus, there's only one of this.

CONCLUSION: Ribbon
-ê

While it's possible to defend from many status effects with Hades-Added Effect
in your Armor, the easiest way is to just use a Ribbon. You can always equip a
different accessory for battles in which you don't need the Ribbon. Against
Emerald, it is useless to equip a Ribbon, for example.

If you don't have your stats maxed out, the Tough Ring, Champion Belt, or
Circlet are also very good accessories. Even the Curse Ring can be good.

 ê|| {AP-6} Interesting facts: Did you know that..? ||
 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-oO

PHS:
-ê
Did you know that PHS stands for Party Hensei (Editing) System? Many people
have probably been pondering about what the 'H' would stand for. There you have
it. The funny thing about the PHS is, that in Japan, people have the Personal
Handiphone System (PHS), basically what we call cell phones. And that's exactly
what the PHS also is in FF7: A cellphone! Since the acronyms are the same, this
is a joke that probably only the Japanese understood.


Test 0:
-ê
There used to be an enemy called Test 0. This enemy was supposedly in the
Japanese version, and could be encountered in pairs of 4 in the well in the
Corel Prison (with the opened box there). They looked the same like the Guard
Hounds you encounter in some reactors at the beginning. They had 25000 HP each,
and gave 1000 Exp, 100 AP, and 10ê gil each. Times 4, that's a big reward for
a battle. They didn't fight back at all, making it a fairly easy battle. This
is what one of the strategy guides has to say about it:

 êhttp://www.ff7citadel.com/rumors/test0.jpg

It's unknown to me if they actually were in the Japanese version. They are
definitely not in any other version though.

Another test creature looked like a Pyramid. It may have also been called
Test 0 (or simply Test). It was fought in groups of 5, and you got 50ê Exp,
50ê gil, and 10ê AP a piece. They are still fightable in the debug room,
which is a test 'area' you can only get to with the help of Gameshark codes.


Unused dialogue:
-ê
Various lines of unused dialogue are still stored on the game's discs. In the
nearby future I'll make a separate section in which the most prominent lines
are analysed.


Getting the Red Submarine:
-ê
All you need to do is fail the submarine mini-game. Basically, this means you
miss out on the Huge Materia (which is pretty bad). If you return to the under-
water reactor you can pass through the door that is normally blocked by the dog.
You will need the Red Submarine to proceed with the game. There's nothing
special about it except that it's.. red. Having it shows that you, well, sucked
at the submarine minigame. It's also indicative for how badly your friends
sucked at that game.


Cait Sith's Manipulate Materia:
-ê
Of course you know the little cat comes with this materia, but did you ever
think about the possibility that it may not be a coincidence that specifically
Cait Sith comes with this particular materia? After all.. Cait Sith surely does
manipulate you a number of times in the story.. does he not?


The Loveless Play:
-ê
This was a side-quest that was left out of the game. The idea was that you got
the 'Loveless Ticket' from Test 0 (see earlier), or perhaps the open chest in
that same well. The ticket allowed access to watch the Loveless Play at the
Event Square, but the whole side quest was left out. There are still references
to the Loveless Play in FF7: There's a large poster in Midgar, right before
meeting the 'flower girl' at the beginning. Cid also mentions the Loveless Play
while on the Highwind:
Cid:  &quot;You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?&quot;
{No}  &quot;Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays.&quot;
{Yes} &quot;Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.&quot;
&quot;They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.&quot;
&quot;An' I remember seein' it just once.&quot;
&quot;That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot.&quot;
&quot;I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.&quot;
&quot;Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.&quot;
&quot;But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.&quot;
&quot;Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up tellin' me my
snorin' was too loud.&quot;
&quot;So about all I really remember of that play is the end&quot;
&quot;The sister of the lead asks her lover,&quot;
&quot;Do you really have to leave?&quot;
&quot;And the guy says,&quot;
&quot;I promised. The people I love, are waiting.&quot;
&quot;I don't understand. Not at all. But please take care of yourself.&quot;
&quot;Of course I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to wait. I'll
 return knowing that you'll be here.&quot;
&quot;I remember thinking when I heard those lines, *&amp;%! What the hell's he talkin'
about? But, you know now I'm not so sure&quot;
&quot;I think I understand.&quot;

It's possible that Cid intends to say something implicitly about Shera this way.


More on Loveless:
-ê
In Crisis Core it becomes even more apparent that the developers of FFVII liked
the band My Bloody Valentine, who made the 1991 album Loveless, but there's also
a reference to this on a poster that one can briefly spot in the background of
the screen in Midgar where Cloud and Aeris first meet.  It's been speculated 
that the woman on the poster bears some resemblance to Belinda Butcher, vocalist
of the band.


The Sister Ray:
-ê
This is a reference to a song by Velvet Underground, one of the favorite bands
of various members of the developing team.


Gighee and Christopher:
-ê
These two enemies are a clear reference to David Bowie's world famous character
Ziggy Stardust.  It has been speculated that &quot;Gighee&quot; is a mistranslation of
&quot;Ziggy&quot;.  Besides both enemies having a glamorous look, and the fact that
Gighee's tail is a guitar, their Stardust March is probably the clearest
reference.  Other attacks, such as Suffocation Song and High/Low Suite, are
easier to interpret when the reference is already known to one.

Of course, both characters always appear together, possibly hinting at the
duality of the Ziggy Stardust/Bowie character.  The name Christopher, finally,
might refer to Christopher Sandford who wrote a biography on Bowie.


Heidegger:
-ê

The name Heidegger refers to the famous (and - for some - notorious) German
philosopher.  Most commonly mentioned is Heidegger's relation to Nazism, which
would refer to FFVII Heidegger's harsh behavior towards other people.  This
doesn't fully do justice to the use of the name Heidegger in FFVII, however.

A reference rarely (if ever) mentioned is that the philosopher Heidegger had
various ideas on how technology influences our life and the world in general.
His notions on how we have been &quot;extracting and demanding nature&quot; for a long
period of time now, instead of &quot;letting nature come to us&quot;, are particularly
striking in resemblance with several major themes in Final Fantasy VII.  While
these ideas don't match FFVII Heidegger's world view - in fact, they're quite
the opposite in FFVII's Heidegger's opinion - this depicts a certain hypocrisy
within the character that can also be seen in the philosopher.  While nowadays,
the philosopher Heidegger is interpreted milder with regards to his ideas on
Nazism (he did dissociate himself from the Nazi party before they had risen to
power, although he never withdrew his ideas, preventing him from giving college
for a while after the war had ended), there is a certain two-sidedness about
Heidegger that's not misplaced in this reference.

Of course, Heidegger's ideas on technology cannot be fully grasped without
reading and comprehending at least parts of his magnum opus Sein und Zeit, in
which he tries to point out that we are continuously 'overjumping' a phenomenon
so close to us, that it's understandable that philosophers before him haven't
spoken of it, that is, the phenomenon of being-in-the-world.

Heidegger explains that we are first and foremost in the world in such a way
that we're using our everyday surroundings as tools, that is, we're in the
world originally as beings that live next to tools such as computers, hammers,
tables, chairs, and so on. We don't view these entities as objects that can
be studied in a scientific way, figuring out how much mass the table has, at
least not first and foremost. We simply act in the world in the way we normally
do, we sit at the table on the chair, using these tools in a specific sense,
namely their everyday purpose (a chair is to be sat on, however, if a burglar
enters your house at night, you might view the chair as a potential weapon to
scare the person off). In short, viewing entities as profitable objects for
sale (which happens all the time with an entity such as oil), is a *specific*
way of looking at that very entity. We can think of entities in a theoretical
way (they have a certain mass, volume, etc.), but that too is a *specific* way
of looking at things, and is a derivative of how we usually view the world.

Heidegger calls the world that surrounds us directly the Umwelt.  In FFVII,
the Umwelt of many people is being threatened by Shinra, exactly because this
company sees the world as one large source from which energy or Mako can be
extracted. Towns such as Corel and Gongaga were ruined because of this point
of view. The morale is that radically viewing the earth from a non-original
point of view like Shinra does, can eventually lead to disastrous events. In
FFVII, this leads - among other things - to the awakening of the WEAPONS. It's
clear that various themes worked out in FFVII have deep philosophical roots,
which in part most definitely explains the game's staying power. A full story
analysis cannot be carried out in this short section, even though there are more
themes to be explored.

It is important to note that Heidegger's philosophical reception exerts a lot of
influence in Japan, and it's rather likely that at least some of the developers
have followed courses on him and his ideas in the late eighties and early
ninetees.


Origin of the crashed rocket in Aeris' church:
-ê.
Cid will hint you the following: &quot;That reminds me, there was a test rocket that
landed in the Slums of Midgar long ago.&quot; He's talking about a rocket that
Shinra launched from Rocket Town a long time ago. It appears it crashed in the
slums of Midgar .. in the church where you met Aeris!


Norwegian mythology:
-ê
The game is drowned with references to mythology. Midgar is a reference to the
world of Midgard in the Norwegian mythology and is the human world.  The Midgard
snake, also known as Jˆrmungandr, is a snake destined to destroy the world in
this mythology.  Nibelheim is a reference to Niflheim, another world in the tree
of Yggdrasil, just like Midgard.  Niflheim is a transition between the
underworld and Midgard.  One could, in a sense, interpret the events in
Nibelheim as a 'transition' from one phase to another.


Cetra:
-ê
The name 'Cetra' comes from the latin word 'cetera', which means others. Indeed
were the Cetra the others on the planet besides the regular human beings.


The text on Jenova's Helmet:
-ê
In-game, you'll only get to see the text on Jenova's helmet for a second, so
it's difficult to read what it says. Below you can read what it actually says,
spelling errors included. The label 'Hong Kong' as the site of production can
possibly be interpreted in a geo-political way (and Jenova being the 'Calamity
from the sky' and all). The Chinese and the Japanese don't get along that well,
after all. Or perhaps it is, in combination with the spelling error, a joke
about Japanese products getting ripped off in Hong Kong (with spelling errors
often found on labels of clothes, packaging, etc). It's not quite the compliment
if you've produced *Jenova*, either. Then again, all of this is just
speculation. Maybe Squaresoft really did goof up themselves with a spelling
error in a major FMV, and either never found out (the text is hard to read,
after all) or if they did, found it too costly to correct. Considering the
game's script has had numerous spelling/gramatical errors, this is not an
unthinkable scenario.

Unused scene and music track:
-ê
Listen to the track here: http://www.ff7citadel.com/secrets/COMICAL.mid

It appears this track (which can still be found on the Japanese version though
hacking) was just left out of the game.  While it's never used in the game, it
was planned for an absolutely hilarious scene in the Honeybee Inn with Palmer, a
Shinra manager and Cloud.  And yes, that's Tifa on the monitor in the
background.

Musical similarities:
-ê
It's a known fact that Nobuo Uematsu has 'drawn inspiration' from a wide variety
of artists.  Consider the following similarities:

Song Name in FFVII ê|Original Song (Original Artist)
-ê"|-ê,
&quot;Those Chosen By The Planet&quot; ê|There's A World (by Neil Young)
&quot;One Winged Angel&quot; ê|Purple Haze (by Jimi Hendrix)

&quot;Forested Temple&quot; (Temple of the  |Is There Anybody Out There? (by Pink Floyd)

&quot;Electric de Chocobo&quot; ê|Wipeout (Surfaris)

There are bound to be many more.  If you hear any other similarities between
songs, please don't hesitate to let me know.


Name of FF7's world:
-ê
Often topic of discussion, there is no 'real official name' for the world. It
is either referred to as 'The Planet', 'Earth', or 'Gaia'. That last name comes
from 'Gaia's Cliffs', which was mistranslated into Gaea's Cliffs.


Amount of slots in Princess Guard &amp; Masamune:
-ê.
All Ultimate Weapons have 8 Slots, except these two. Princess Guard has 7 Slots
which makes it unique.. Perhaps this has something to do with this being the
seventh FF.. whereas Aeris is perhaps THE key character of the game. It's also
remarkable that the Princess Guard is the ONLY Ultimate Weapon that has
materia slots with growth. Another coincidence? Or is this linked to Aeris'
ability to exert influence on the life stream...?

The Masamune has 6 Slots. The number 6 is often associated with evil or the
devil (think of 666). Why weren't there eight slots in the Masamune?  Is this
another coincidence? Decide for yourself.


The 'Red Man' in the Corel Prison Well:

 êOo*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=-*=oO

In the summer of 2012, Square Enix decided to re-release FFVII for the PC.
Several fixes have been made, including the Magic Defense Bug (armor adds that
statistic properly now). They also included a 'character booster' which allowed
players to automatically boost their levels and so on. This completely castrated
that version of the game and the people who ever decided to put that in deserve
to undergo the same fate. It's literally ... no, I'm not ... I don't even want
to put it into words because that would assume the situation can be adequately
captured in semantics.

To finish this guide I could use some help on the following subjects:

o Information regarding the Gold Saucer Speed Square:
  * How many points can the Zeppelin Propellor give in the PC version of the
 êgame, and what is the max points that can be scored by hitting it?
  * I need confirmation of how many specific targets there really are. This
 êincludes, but is not limited to the large Icicle Shards in the Ice Cave.

o Information regarding the Gold Saucer Chocobo Races:
  * What are the specific chances for items to *show up* in the Chocobo Races,
 êcategorized by the four different racing classes?

o Information on the chances of having a specific item stolen from you by one
  of the enemies that can do this (such as Bandits, Vice). This information is
  important in the context of the extended W-Item trick.

o The G-Bike challenge:
  * What's the highest score one can achieve without using emulator tools?
 êIn other words, what's the highest practically achievable score?

July 7th, 2006
-ê
Started this project.

November 14, 2006
-ê
Many updates have been made, and the whole Guide is almost complete. Things
left to do are the Materia section, small typoes, perhaps a FAQ section, maybe
a Music Section, and maybe the amount of damage attacks can do from enemies.
I am probably not including an enemy section. People can check Terence's list
for a great list on that. The whole document has stayed surprisingly compact,
too! Seems like my goals are going to be accomplished. And why not.. I'm just
going to send this in. Check back frequently for updates ;)

February 1, 2007
-ê
Large spellcheck done, and minor additions to several sections.

February 10, 2007
-ê
Added additional, detailed information on all Attacks for all Bosses.

07/07/07 (and beyond)
-ê
Many additions, including the 'Did You Know' section, many Appendices, and more
details on various things as Mechanics. This date is the perfect date to also
release the FAQ in its best state. Here it is, including more info about a
Perfect Game, Music Section, Picture links for all Armor, Weapons, Accessories
Materia, and much more.

Updates Version Perfect +
-ê
o Additional section about un-mastered Materia added.
o Item list re-organized.
o Added Date Mechanics section {M1.6}. Figured it wouldn't hurt.
o Added an Elixir treasure in the Gaea's Cliff. This one slipped through.
o Updated section {INF-2} with Front and Backrow information.
o Added in-depth character section.
o Corrections in the Speed Square target table.
o Added a brand new logo sketch and renewed the layout.

Ultimate
=ê
This is the final stage of the FAQ, and any further updates will only consist of
minor corrections. All sections are now complete. For the updates, see below:

o Made the definitive logo.
o Added the Enemy Encyclopedia for completion purposes.
  Holy hell, that took a lot of time. Yes, that's where that 700KB came from.
o Added enemy encounter list.
o Added Overflow info.
o Added BradyGames Guide Error List.
o Added Max Natural HP/MP charts.
o Minor typo fixes [30/10/'08].
o Polished: Lost Forevers List and Optional Things in the Buggy.
o Spllchechk doen. Yes, spellcheck done.
o Corrections to Max Natural HP/MP charts. More errors may still exist.
o Major correction (twice) on Cait Sith's Max Natural HP chart.
o Added NTSC Snowboarding times.
o Added Don Corneo's Choice mechanics.
o Added Shinra Elevator mechanics.
o Corrected Max Natural HP/MP Charts (they should be accurate now..(?)).
o Started a complete re-write.

Note: After the 07/07/07 'Ultimate' version update, it became apparent that
secrets were still being discovered and that there were still too many small
things that needed updating. I therefore decided to include the dates of the
updates coming after the Ultimate version below so people can see what's new and
what they might have missed ever since they checked this guide for the last
time.

05 October 2010:
=ê
o Partially went through the queue of emails and made several minor fixes.
o Fixed Unknown 2 entry.
o Typo fixes.
o W-Item note at Whirlwind Maze has been removed. Extended trick will follow.
o Several date affection value notes have been added, as well as a very quick
  guide on how to date any of the four characters in a nutshell.
o Corrections on Aeris' and Cait Sith's names.
o Fixed Bugenhagen's age.
o Shed some light on the 20th (unfightable) battle at Fort Condor. This section
  should now finally be 100% complete and accurate.

29 November 2010:
=ê
o Fixed Yuffie's Max Natural MP chart (Level 60 and 61).

03 June 2011:
=ê
o Numerous additions in the AP-6 section, most notably an entry on Heidegger.
o Small update on the mechanic in Cosmo Canyon.
o Small commentary on Tifa/Scarlet bitchfight.
o Section PER-3 now includes some commentary on the extended W-Item trick.
  I will probably elaborate on this some more in the future.
o Corrected small errors on the max safety level table in section PER-7.
  (Barret was 53, corrected into 54.  RedXIII was 51, corrected into 53.
   Yuffie was 53, corrected into 52.)
o Added some section headers at the beginning of the walkthrough. Some minor
  other ones might come soon.
o Minor other things that you may or may not notice by reading everything. ;)

11 August 2011:
=ê
o Minor correction on the Vagyrisk Claw stealing mechanics example.

06 January 2012:
=ê
o Minor additional explication on the meaning of Corneo's name.
o Minor addition regarding underwear at the Wall Market.
o Added minor explications regarding Aps and Rapps, as well as the origin of
  their names, which leads to a plausible interpretation of Rapps' true name.
o Removed poison weakness in Demons Gate main boss strategy.  Added an
  additional tip.

13 January 2012:
=ê
o Added Aeris' Max Natural HP/MP progression charts.

31 January 2012:
=ê
o 15th anniversary of the game!
o Rewritten the 3-D Battler section and added in-depth mechanics.
o Reformatted and (fully) corrected the Max Natural HP/MP progression charts,
  with help from Erzfreund.  The charts now combine HP and MP together.  In the
  old charts there were a few (harmful) errors in Cid's chart in levels 51-57.
  Other errors were less harmful and some additional values have been added.
  Aeris' chart has also been corrected and should be fully functional now.
o Massive spellcheck.

12 March 2012:
=ê
o Added some additional information on escapes.
o Minor spelling corrections.
o Added a note on the first person ever to complete the Max Natural HP/MP
  challenge on 7 March, 2012 (songsengrim).

27 March 2012:
=ê
o Added chance information on Tifa &amp; Cid asking Cloud to ride the chocobo
  races or to snowboard.
o Elaborated on the crater duplication trick and differentiated between two
  scenario's: One in which you'll duplicate the Mystile and Imperial Guard,
  the other in which you'll duplicate the Mega All Materia. In both scenarios
  the (Command) Counter Materia and the Shield Materia are duplicated.
o Requested new information in section XII, the Wanted List.
o Minor fixes in the Battle Square section.

02 April 2012:
=ê
o Rewritten/reformatted the main outline of the introductory section for
  perfect games. The most important change is the swapping of the 'clearing the
  Gold Saucer' requirement to level 4 (from level 2). The main reason for this 
  is that no one has ever done this in history. In other words, it's probably 
  harder than maxing natural HP/MP, since it requires a LOT of skill! It also 
  means that no one has ever completed the level 4 (or 5) challenge before.
o Requested the maximum (practical) score of the G-Bike mini game.

19 May 2012:
=ê
o Minor fixes.
o Added information regarding the 'Repeating Boss Glitch', which allows you to
  fight almost any boss fight twice.  This has small consequences for completing
  a perfect game, since two bosses (Lost Number and Godo) drop unique items that
  couldn't be duplicated regularly by W-Item tricks (Cosmo Memory and All
  Creation).  The perfect game notes have been adjusted to reflect this change
  (and #15 has been added). The trick is explained in more detail in section
  {AP-4}, towards the end.  A shout-out goes to researcher BrutalAl.

24 May 2012:
=ê
o Added additional information to the parading minigame section.

June/July 2012:
=ê
o Various minor textual edits, and some small content changes.
o Small changes in the Gold Saucer Battle Square strategy sections.
o Improved and expanded the explanatory section on Heidegger in appendix 6.
o Added the official name of the game's official trailer music, its composer,
  and quite some information regarding other versions of the track and where
  they can be found and bought. Definitely listen to that piece of music, as
  it'll either bring you feelings of nostalgia or introduce you to an amazing
  song that you'll want to hear anyway.
o Next update will include more fixes and small additions.

August 2012:
=ê
o Minor fixes and updates. Larger updates will follow later this month.
o Added a note regarding mastering the Underwater Materia. For anyone doing a
  perfect game it's important to note that this is now part of the challenge,
  from Level 1 and upward.
o Added a section {AP-7} with information on the new re-release, including an
  achievements list. More information will follow.
o Added HP Absorb to the list of un-mastered materia maxing.

September 2012:
=ê
o Added the Save Crystal glitch in appendix section 4, and added notes on the
  perfect game sections to reflect this change.

07 July 2013:
=ê
o Updated information regarding the perfect game challenge, including info on
  how to get 99 copies of All Creation. This involves the repeating boss trick.
o Some minor corrections in the walkthrough.
o More updates will follow, especially with regards to getting certain other
  unique materia (relevant only to the perfect game challenge).
o This guide exists 7 years on July the 7th, 2013! Everyone, thank you very
  much for reading, and be sure to recommend your friends another playthrough
  of FFVII along with this guide!

09 July 2013:
=ê
o Perfect Game Note 19 has been added in, which includes a trick on how to
  duplicate both the unique unmastered materia Alexander and Added Cut in the
  Great Glacier.
o The unique Un-Mastered Materia section has been updated to include the
  requirement for getting at least two copies of Alexander and Added Cut, along
  with keeping their 'source' available.

03 September 2013:
=ê
o Minor improvements implemented into the walkthrough.
o More accurate data added regarding the Speed Square's Zeppelin.
o Big update to the Un-mastered materia section. Instructions for duplicating
  Added Cut have been added, as well as completely new instructions on how to
  duplicate the Phoenix Materia. A perfect game note has been added into the
  main walkthrough as well. Please note that the Un-mastered materia section
  will receive another update sometime in the future, regarding duplicatable
  materia in the Northern Crater. Those attempting a Perfect Game may want to
  be cautious, but then again, there's no certainty that other tricks won't be
  found in the near future on top of that.

17 March 2014:
=ê
o Various spelling mistakes corrected.
o Additional information on Ultimate WEAPON added.
o The Submarine Minigame information adjusted.
o Several minor edits.

27 July 2014:
=ê
o Added a minor note on how failing to sneak past the guards five times at the
  60th floor in Shinra Building will allow the team free passage.
o Added a note on how to get Aqualung even earlier in the game.
o Added in a new link for the 'Final Encounter' trailer music. The old one was
  apparently no longer working due to a site remodeling. Someone should try and
  get the original files from that website. Who knows it might go down someday,
  and the CD seems quite rare. In any case, listen to the different versions of
  the trailer music now that you still have the chance. It's an amazing piece of
  music (and not composed by Uematsu)!
o I've also released a (low quality due to size restrictions) World Map. This
  was going to be an exclusive full color poster in the Seventh Heaven FFVII
  guide, but ever since that project was cancelled I had it sitting on my
  hardrive. Figured it could be of some use to people since it's by far the
  most complete World Map available, so I've decided to release it for free.
